    WebSocket endpoint for streaming real-time workflow progress updates.

    Clients connect to this endpoint with a correlation_id to receive live updates
    about workflow execution including agent progress, completion status, and errors.

    Args:
        websocket: The WebSocket connection
        correlation_id: Unique identifier for the workflow to monitor

    WebSocket Message Format:
        {
            "type": "WORKFLOW_STARTED" | "AGENT_EXECUTION_STARTED" | "AGENT_EXECUTION_COMPLETED" | "WORKFLOW_COMPLETED" | "WORKFLOW_FAILED",

            "correlation_id": str,
            "agent_name": str | None,
            "status": str,
            "progress": float,  # 0.0 to 100.0
            "message": str,  # Human-readable status message
            "metadata": {
                "execution_time_ms": float | None,

                "error_message": str | None
            }
        }

    Connection Lifecycle:
        1. Client connects to /ws/query/{correlation_id}
        2. Server validates correlation_id format
        3. WebSocket connection accepted
        4. Client subscribed to receive events for that correlation_id
        5. Real-time events streamed as workflow executes
        6. Connection cleaned up on disconnect

    Error Handling:
        - Invalid correlation_id format: Connection rejected with 1008 code
        - Network disconnection: Automatic cleanup of subscriptions
        - Broadcast errors: Logged but don't terminate connection

    Examples:
        - Connect: ws://localhost:8000/ws/query/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
        - Receive: {"type": "WORKFLOW_STARTED", "progress": 0.0, "message": "Workflow execution started"}
        - Receive: {"type": "AGENT_EXECUTION_STARTED", "agent_name": "refiner", "progress": 5.0, "message": "Starting Refiner agent"}
        - Receive: {"type": "WORKFLOW_COMPLETED", "progress": 100.0, "message": "Workflow completed successfully"}
