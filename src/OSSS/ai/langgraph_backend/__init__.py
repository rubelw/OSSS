"""
LangGraph Backend Module

This module provides graph building and compilation services for CogniVault's
LangGraph integration. It separates graph construction concerns from execution
orchestration for better maintainability and testability.

Key Components:
- GraphFactory: Core graph building and compilation
- GraphPatterns: Predefined graph structures for common use cases
- GraphCache: Compilation caching for performance optimization
