        Let’s work on geography together! 🌍  
        I’ll ask a couple quick questions, then we’ll break things down step by step.

  # FORM QUESTIONS
  utter_ask_geography_mentor_form_geo_topic:
    - text: >
        What geography topic do you want help with?
        (e.g. world capitals, continents and oceans, climate zones, maps and coordinates)

  utter_ask_geography_mentor_form_geo_level:
    - text: >
        Roughly what level are you at? You can say basic, intermediate, or advanced.

  utter_ask_geography_mentor_form_geo_question:
    - text: >
        Great. What specific question or problem are you working on?

  # ANSWER TEMPLATE (for simple version without custom actions)

        Here’s a helpful way to think about that: 
        {geo_question}
        \n\nFor {geo_topic} at a {geo_level} level, I’d explain it like this…
        \n\n(You can now adjust this response logic or hook it up to another service.)

actions:
  # keep your existing actions like action_suggest_careers
  # if you later create a Python custom action, add it here, e.g.:
  - action_answer_geography
