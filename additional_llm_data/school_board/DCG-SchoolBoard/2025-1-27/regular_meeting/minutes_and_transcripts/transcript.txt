hello my name is Jenna best I'm the owner of wandering raccoon books just down the street here in
Grimes I'm a West Moine resident but I am a Grimes business member Grimes
chamber member and I support the school through the fine arts program uh the dcg PTO
and one other thing I cannot remember off the top of my head I apologize sorry
pressure I've prepared a statement today so members of the board thank you for hearing me
today uh I asked to speak today regarding the potential removal of two graphic novels here from dcg
libraries while many people may choose to later discuss the literary credentials of both of these works or
the utilization of the First Amendment right to free speech I'm coming with a slightly different
perspective stories are like parts of a house bear with me stories act as doors they open our
imagination to new worlds stories also act as mirrors seeing yourself reflected
in the characters helps you relate to and empathize with the story stories also act as
Windows here you can see beyond the curtain and into the experiences of someone else someone that's not like
you these stories have been communicated in many ways across human history oral
storytelling is our deep deepest and oldest tradition and it lives on today through audio books and reading to our
own children pictoral story telling came next these are graphic
novels this lives on in many many ways today including these graphic novels
excuse me and Comics it's only relatively recently that storytelling that relies solely on
the written word has become the popular default regardless L of this method of
Storytelling one aspect has remained constant across time all methods act as
doors windows and mirrors I do want to remain respectful
of my time limit today and the the public commentary but if you'll just
indulge me in a small group participation exercise this is silent so
no worries I'm just going to ask you to think for a moment I'm willing to bet
that many of you don't immediately see common ground in these
stories it feels like that window is blocked let me open the curtain for you
I want everyone to think do you speak Spanish even a few words handful of
vocabulary I have a feeling most everyone here can say yes at least in some
capacity now did you know for example that Spanish and Arabic share about 8%
of their vocabulary because the languages are related the smallest piece of Common
Ground can open that curtain now the window is open look through it and you can
discover so many wonderful experiences from people all across the world discourage this and you board up your
windows members of the board let us not exist in a dark house with boarded up Windows where fear and hate can Fester
let us open them and allow light empathy and kindness in I thank you for your
time that was less than five minutes I thank you very
much thank you Miss
Perez hello big stranger to the school board um hi I am Denise Perez and I'm a
Grimes resident and Mom of a dcg senior uh go class of
2025 first and foremost thank you to the board and those indiv those individuals who agreed to participate in both
reconsideration committees it is important to recognize as a community that these are volunteers who have jobs
and families and their time matters I wanted to show some support um and Grace
for our school district and the challenges education is facing in the current political environment at the
state and now the federal level um I have to believe that the teachers Librarians and administrators within our
district have the knowledge and desire to equip our students with the tools they will need to thrive outside of the
dcg bubble the world outside of dcg is diverse and
complex that is why it's important to have books like American Born Chinese and I was their American dream in our
classrooms I can tell you as a first generation American my life experiences
were not reflected in the books I read in school however I grew up in a diverse
immigrant community so it wasn't that big a deal I was learning about white people who were mythical creatures we
only saw on TV and read about however I have seen the impact of
not having access to diverse stories I moved to Iowa in 2002 and the worst
racism I have experienced is that folks asse I'm Mexican because of my last name
now I am white I speak English I am middle class so that is the worst I have
had to experience however dcg students are
experiencing racism bullying and harassment and that is with access to
these books while dcg as a whole is in Banning books that's just one parent we
do have a huge gap in cultivating empathy and kindness for those different
than us thank you thank you uh we move along to item
four uh agenda are there any changes to the agenda yes thanks Ryan two changes
to the agenda team one is we got today uh the musical theater contract so we
want to get that onto the agenda um so we can get that approved so Oak viw can
get off and running um with their musical so that would give them the rights to their music so we added that
and then there was just a couple of incorrect dates we found on the calendar so we adjusted those today to make sure
those were accurate so we've we've updated the the calendar that we'll talk about new business to um have those
changes those two items and we're going to add the contract of the consent agenda is that correct yes okay looking
for a motion move to approve MCN second yellow any
discussion all those in favor indicate by saying I I oose same sign motion
carries uh moving along to item five uh approval of previous meeting minutes
we've got three um December the 16th regular meeting A6 special meeting and a
113 board Workshop looking for a motion V to approve Vander then second Baker
Curtis any discussion all those in favor indicate by saying I I oppose same sign moving
along to bills looking for a motion move to approve fella second Baker Curtis any
discussion all those in favor indicate by saying I I oppose same sign motion
carries moving along to item seven the consent agenda looking for a
motion move to approve MCN second vand any discussion I have a question
about the open enrollment so sub sub section B um pardon me um I think it's really
exciting that we're seeing all of these new students join us I couldn't I'd be remiss if I didn't ask though um with
seven new kindergarteners coming from a variety of of districts what buildings are those kids going
to so there would be most of our sorry M most of our kindergartens we put an
extra uh room at South Prairie so right now any kindergarten that that comes to
dcg if there is a building that is too many sections or or too full they go to
South Prairie so there's room for seven kindergarteners at South Prairie in their five sections correct wonderful
well we're happy to have them yes thanks I did have some a couple questions actually um continuing on that
when we have students that move to online do we pay for that or is that just someone that's out of our
yeah technically right it's it's a little both so we we pay for it we have essentially kind of a a with at mum we
pay for like the range you can you can have this many kids within this so if we stay in there that's one solid number
what about the like IO connections and I got you that's a that's like an open and rolled out that's I thought exactly so
that's like going to a brand new District okay so we're not seeing even though we're seeing the money for those because we already certified next year
we would not see exactly okay yep that's ones that will be be sent on to Iowa connections yep and then for the logos
um that's a pretty big difference in cost y um so one I was just curious on
what we see that that estimated funds is going to raise now and two what is Affiliated versus non Affiliated yeah so
a couple things we are you know when we compare with our friends around us we're way behind or below maybe not
behind Below in we want our people to to use our logo
but we're we're seeing a little bit of free with that it's just a you know a
pretty simple um amount that isn't necessarily helping dcg again we're not
looking to make money off of this but we want to be serious enough Affiliated non Affiliated the easiest way to maybe
describe that Shay and team is the Affiliated ones are we want to make
uniforms for you right we want to be the the group that does um all of your
basketball teams all of your soccer team like they want to do uniforms not
affiliate is like we want to help um do t-shirts like a local exactly okay yeah
we just want to have T-shirts available for for kids and families to be able so every organization so I know like price soccer gets their jerseys from somewhere
else then basketball so those all will be paying that fee okay correct exactly yep and AJ's done a heck of a job with
this so they'll be on like we want to have but then he'll keep track of like okay the contract rotation so okay you
know people are certainly made aware when their contract is up and we've shared with our coaches and and sponsors
this change and and and all of the the groups that currently have a contract they're all well aware of this okay
sorry one more on E on the therapeutic classroom I'm just kind of curious on what that is and it sounds very
interesting um and what we what do we think that cost is going to be like we have there cost listed there so I was
just curious thanks that's Michelle I'm G to defer to you if you can help me grab it so this is
a you know a student that was in another District okay who now has moved to dcg
okay but because of their special education needs the previous district and winet had access to the student
using their therapeutic classroom okay so dcg not wanting to kind of midyear
okay mess with this child's current Arrangement one it's one child who's who's now uh parents have moved here so
we're now essentially paying for that child to continue their practice in Winter set that's great Y and Michelle I
don't know if you had a number off hand but we can track it down I just didn't I didn't know if it was like a mass amount
that were going or what was happening that so one one student that that attends that classroom and I have a
question also on that so therapeutic classrooms are popping up in districts all over the state and I'm just
wondering how far off are we as a district from developing this sort of a therapeutic classroom for our special
education students here at dcg great question it is something we've we've talked about frequently um so Nancy a
timeline next year in two years I don't have a good answer for you we've seen some like Winterset who have kind of a
vibrant one we've seen our friends in Johnston who now have one but I believe they just have a couple of students so
we've we've talked about it little bit of a staffing conversation you know we need to have around that with our budget
but big fans at the district leadership of it it's just the timing and when the
Staffing and stuff works I I don't have a good answer there but on certainly on our radar and on our discussions
so just to follow up that I I know that um the tag family members were invited
recently to have an opportunity to provide input um I think if the dcg uh
population were invited for those special education students it would be an interesting indicator to find out how
many families would be interested in having an opportunity for their children to have access to something like that
yep so if I would be interested to on that sort of a feedback loop you got it
thanks further discussion's making I'm making I was
just gonna add I think that's I would just piggyback off of what Dr Bloom has said I think we wouldn't be remiss if we
hadn't already thought of it you know as to what it looks like we go back to in a day and age when it's hard to find
special education teachers we have to think about Staffing what the what the whole room like you know is there
Associates in there what's the Staffing ratio look like and then how many students in our district would qualify
for that that program in our district if we didn't have enough kind of like our alternative Ed program perhaps we would
consider taking people from outside so it's a long range but I don't want to put it so far out I I don't want to
speak for Dr Bloom because there's a lot of moving Parts but budgetary wise we we would have to put a lot of pieces
together um with our new director of student services coming on board I think those will be conversations we can
continue to engage in and learn from her experiences as well
further discussion all those in favor indicate by saying I I post same sign motion
carries uh move along to item eight this is the time and place for the public hearing and for the meeting on a Day
verse hour with the start date of August 25th 2025 for the school calendar for
the 25 26 school year are there any questions comments or objections from
those present seeing none uh Miss wouth Board
secretary uh have you had any objections filed in the secretary's office no objections have been
filed I declare the hearing on the matter on a days verse hours with the start date of August 25th 2025 for the
school calendar for the 2526 school year is closed moving along to reports any
questions on the written reports all right we'll move along to
building level reports Miss
Dodge hello and thank you for letting us be on your agenda this evening my name
is Pam Dodge and I'm the interim principal at the middle school and turn it on Hello should I say that again was
my teacher voice in effect and maybe everybody heard that so again thank you for allowing us to be here tonight I'm
not here alone I have my building leadership team here I guess they don't let me go out by myself very often and
we do look kind of dinged up we have somebody on crutches I've recently had hip surgery we have somebody else with a
foot issue so um I just don't want you to think it's really you know falling apart over there at the middle school so
um anyway I think I'm going to let them introduce themselves and then we're going to run through a few
things do you want to just do it from your seats since we're so dinged up is that okay
Sarah sixth grade teer Grant grade math and
science okay I know you've seen this before because you're a school board I know you've heard a lot about school
Improvement and where you know that those are the things that the buildings are often talking about this happens to
be the framework or the goals that the district or bu buildings are putting um
their work underneath and so this summer when I was new and we came together as a
building leadership team we had a retreat and we started to talk about what are the goals we have in place what
does our student data look like um where are opportunities to learn and grow and
so um sometimes you live in the public relations world where you're sharing all the great things that are happening at
your school this team often lives in that school Improvement model where they're often digging into where doing
great here but we need to improve in this particular area so that's where we've been spending our energy this year
talking about what do our students need what does a comprehensive program look like for fifth and sixth graders and
tonight we're going to give you just a little bit of an overview and a little bit of a look into the work underway and
the work that we're looking forward um more than just this year um a lot of the things that we're starting to work on
this year and and train teachers around are things that are going to be multi-year initiative but working within
this framework and District level goals so I think this is when I kick it off to Chris and she talks a little bit more
about that uh BLT if you want to let me click I can
click all right uh good evening um so as um Dr
Dodge had mentioned our BLT we met uh for a summer Retreat and uh acronyms get
thrown around all the time so BLT stands for building leadership team uh we discussed at that time with having a new
leader in place what was the purpose of our team how we could use our time together during the school year as a
piece of our overall School improvement work um we represent most of us represent the PLC leaders in our
building we also are the same people that attended the PLC leader launch in August prior to the school year uh the
summer retreat was a turning point for our building for a couple different reasons Dr Dodge facil itated a process
to help us see the work underway and we collaborated and determined what work needs to be started and continued to
ensure that we're meeting the needs of our students to the best of our abilities during our Retreat uh we
collaborated and we prioritized the next steps for our building the purpose of our BLT is actually twofold one of which
it's leading our plc's as PLC Leaders with the help of our instructional coach it's leading uh our teams and also the
other part of the BLT the second part of that is just leading the building and the learning that's taking place as a
whole in the building through our conversations and summer planning we quickly determined that our building as
a whole needed to do more learning around the mtss process again I'll
explain that that's the multi-tiered systems of support and it was clear to us that this needed to be our priority
this year we determined that we must establish time to learn about this process as a building and we discussed
how we would go about about doing that this year as the time at the time we felt that this was our greatest and best
opportunity to bring together our two grade levels around one common goal and we knew it would impact our culture of
our building in a positive way for both the adults and the students in our building currently our BLT meets on a
regular basis to prepare prepare for professional development we explore our building level data and we also plan for
the leadership needed for the various plc's why you may ask am I starting us off one
I think I've been around here for a while as a fifth grade teacher I can
tell you I've have been at three different buildings as a fifth grade teacher I started my career at Dallas
Center Elementary uh after 14 years I moved as a fifth grade teacher same grade over to Heritage Elementary when
we were part of the K4 model and then three and a half years ago I made that move to the middle school so I want to
talk I feel like I'm the right person to come into this room tonight to talk about this we really when we came
together we had two identities coming together we had that of a fifth grade
what the fifth grade teachers were bringing in we were coming with that more of an elementary model and
philosophy with us and then we had sixth grade that that building's been through lots of transitions sixth and seventh
seventh and eighth but it was operating more of that of a middle school and we really discovered in the last three and
a half years that we really had had a little bit of an identity we were just meshing those two models together and so
that's part of what you're going to hear about tonight are going to be the priorities that have come out of our uh
leadership time when we did our Retreat um the other thing we found interesting is when we were talking about that
identity with fifth and sixth grade when the district strategic planning committee did the survey at the middle
school that was the topic that came to the Forefront so it wasn't as if we were only feeling that as the building
leadership team but we did when I sit in on that committee when we met at Oakview
all that data and Survey data that came through that was a common theme that we were missing an identity as one building
the meshing of that um so I will say to you tonight as the other team members come up and present this is just a
snapshot of the work that we prioritize for this year and we plan on doing thank you for your time
here um I'm going to talk a little bit about plc's um we are very fortunate
that the district has put in many resources for training teachers on the process of professional learning
communities our plcs use the four questions to guide the work we do um plc's are a priority for our building
they are embedded in our schedule so teachers can meet multiple times a week working through the PLC process allows
us to differentiate our our plc's some examples include um Ela is working on
their new curriculum implementation we've got book studies evaluating assessments looking at data and inviting
our curriculum facilitators and director of teaching and learning to discuss best practices and brainstorm ideas to best
meet the needs of our students um PC is our main professional learning vehicle
our next Avenue of work is to delve into what highquality core instruction looks like to ensure all students learn at a
high level
all right I am bootless so we've got we've got one more boot coming don't worry um as you've heard about from
Chris and from Stacy when we opened our fifth and sixth grade building we recognized the need that we needed to merge some things together one of them
was our mtss that Chris referenced um or maybe Pam referenced that multi-tiered system of support Stacy just reference
that really our academics are really focused in our PLC work so as a building leadership team we want to focus on our
behavior when we did our Gap analysis we realized we did not have common things in place for our building so our Focus
has been and through the help of Emily Donovan we are focusing on mtss best practices and we have created a tier one
team that is really diving in and doing some training with Emily this year we are developing common expectations for
our building that will be for students and teachers to utilize we are developing lesson plans to help teach
those expectations to our students students and whether you like it or not PB whatever you want to call it our mtss
Behavior we want to recognize the positive things that are happening with students not just the corrective Behavior so all of that learning is
happening this year so that we can Implement things starting on day one next year um while our tier one team
which consists of not our building leadership team they are getting task with the rest of our staff to look at
and revamp our Student Assistance process and protocol so if you hear us talk about sat our Student Assistance
team um we have some fors that are floating out there but once again a
merging of an elementary versus a middle school we knew we needed to look at that so the last two building professional
development Wednesdays our BLT members have led that work with our team um of teachers all teachers have been provided
the opportunity to have input on what these Pro process and Protocols are going to be so that we can once again
meet the needs of all of our students but also we can communicate with the other adults in our building very very
very clearly um through these documents that they're looking at but also through the processes so mtss huge work we've
got academics and we've got
Behavior naturally I'm going to talk a little bit about special education um so over the last five years our building
and our department has faced a lot of significant challenges um including High turnover among teachers and Associates
and being really understaffed um this instability really impacted not only the consistency of instruction for our
students but also the support our Educators received however I feel like we've reached a turning point through a
systematic redesign we've made a commitment to creating strong supportive culture within our department now that we're appropriately staffed we can
operate effectively as our professional Learning Community we have weekly meetings where they've been established
as a Cornerstone of this approach um they allow us to prioritize especially designed and instruction analyze our
student data collaboratively and ensure accountability um the key points we've
really worked hard on are looking at the goal progress and Analysis to improve the outcomes for all students thoughtful
scheduling of students to meet their academic and behavioral needs and collaborating very closely with our
general education teachers uh to develop problemsolving practices that support every child um we also are providing
targeted training for our Associates this year which has been very amazing they we we've heard nothing but amazing
things from them about how grateful they are to be able to learn a little bit about how they can meet the best for our
our students um we've already found this commitment to payoff we focused a lot on
collaboration accountability and supporting all of our staff and students and we're building a department of
culture where teachers Associates and general education staff are equipped to succeed together we're creating an
environment where every student can Thrive and I'm really part proud to be part of this process additionally our
special ed teachers have been examining the Continuum of services that we offer within our building one strategy that we
would really like to add to our Continuum is to offer a co-taught section of math next year why math well
because we have a teacher that's really interested in it and that really wants to try it so um to do this properly we're going to need to evaluate the math
goals within our building and determine if we can schedule a section where co- teaching makes sense um we also need to
make sure that our general education and special education have the opportunity to have the training this summer to be
successful at that so as we continue to grow and learn how to meet the needs of our students we are committed to improve
our transition protocols too for example this spring we're going to collaborate across all four of our elementary
buildings to learn about our current for our incoming fifth graders current fourth graders this year so we can
priority schedule them into the building schedules as we plan for next school year this will ensure that we can place
them into a proper building level program and all of our best practices are in IEPs are
followed all right hi everyone I get the honor to share a little bit about of a cool unique experience our sixth graders
got to have this past December um just to provide a little bit of background information dcg partnered with a program
called Junior Achievement and this partnership includes students from K through sixth grade uh the program
covers financial literacy work and career Readiness and Entrepreneurship the sixth grade program includes a
unique experience called bis toown if you've talked to a sixth grader since December they probably have mentioned
Bown um this is an opportunity for them to take all of the learning that they've
had and have this unique experience where they get to live it out in person and get to have a life experience that
kind of is a little unique and not inside the classroom walls as most of our experiences are in our school system
um in order to prepare for this big day the sixth graders had to go through a couple of units of study that was done
by our social our social studies team uh they ran through a lot of different topics that were necessary in order to
get a local economy running um a huge shout out to that sixth grade social studies team there was a lot of lifting
that needed to take place in order for this day to go smoothly for everybody um a lot of time and effort some did
interviews for the students some had to go out of their way to make sure that their placement was correct for the
student to have success on the day that they actually got to experience the event um some of the topics included
were financial literacy community and economy work and career Readiness and business management after developing
their business plans and completing all the required paperwork to get their business up and running they were ready for their big day in December all sixth
grade classes no more than three a day just because of the amount of space that they have got to go to bis toown it was
a truly inclusive experience that was also enjoyed by our level three students who were each given a position that best allowed them to leverage their strengths
and contribute to their community in a meaningful way although I could talk talk about the value of this experience the rest of the night we felt it would
be better for you to hear from the individuals who actually got to live it and thanks to AJ and all of his work he was able to put together a video that
truly embodies The Experience I'm back on biztech radio
that was the CFO for a retail shop and responsibility was to pay our bills and
like anything that has to do with money I was the district attorney I solved many like cases like the missing teddy
bear and I traveled around the town asking for envelopes and asking for
confidential things I was the CFO for construction and my responsibilities were like paying the taxes and doing all
the online work stuff I worked as a food manager in the restaurant and it was really fun just like making food and
getting to serve it to people we had to learn how to like and learn the different payments
and then uh learn how to use the cost sheet to track what you use on like
debit on your debit card that you get when you're there this tunnel was a place for young kids to learn about um
learn about what adults do in their daily day daily lives you have to like
actually write stuff to know like what you spent so people or so you can remember what you spent and like what
you like spent your money on we were all working on business trackers so we all had the right amount of money and we all
learned how to save money correctly you can spend and save money but if you spend too much money you won't have
enough money left to pay your bills and do all the stuff to that you actually need to
do I could have just I'm back
on but thankfully then we're going to let make me stand for very long so I get to thank you guys for listening and
letting us present all of these amazing things going on at our Middle School uh if you have any questions feel free to
reach out to any of us and want to respect your time so you can get back to your work
thank you thank you all very
much Dr Kenza okay um have a lot on tonight's agenda so I'm just going to
skim through most of it as you can see what we've been working on first I just want to keep you updated on our
professional development schedule a highlight for us would have been our January 20th full day professional
development and just a um that schedule is included there um underneath the 20th
so that's the only one that we have in year that's full day um but we try and keep in mind adult learning theory we
still took it as a chance to get together as all of our staff and then also give PLC time and building time so
try to keep people moving in different uh rotations but I really felt great we took the opportunity as a district to
focus on uh the learning environment which applies to all staff in the strong framework everybody's learning
environment looks a little bit different depending on your role um so questions about
PD pretty straight forward um Essa update just a quick update there so as
you know Oak viiew as we from our learned from our board work session Oakview and the high school have been identified as a targeted uh School for
students with disabilities with IEPs and so we're working to begin the process of data review analysis goal setting all
that process we um won't turn that directly into the state but we can provide evidence to them because they
don't receive Title One funds but the work is still happening regard regardless we had a great team you can see the timeline where we're going to
have regular check-ins both Joan and Travis have worked hard with their teams to narrow into one or two shortterm and
one long-term goal and then um you can kind of see I just want to illustrate
how it feeds into professional development for next year so we're really getting to that point in fact it's on Tuesday's admin agenda for our
administrative team to start talking about what does the professional development cycle and planning and goal
setting look like for 25 26 what's helpful is we have that data review from Essa so we also have that as
one piece that we're going to consider um we'll look at um we went we won't have isas back till the end of May but
we'll have other data points that we can review with them and and so you can see how it all ties together questions about
Essa maybe just one the so we had an Essa plan last year and now that they've
changed um kind of the calculation and those things is is that Essa plan still
in progress or is that completed now and we've moved on to kind of this work here great question I would best describe it
as a reset okay so um what goals in fact when we talked about like part of the
Essa process is a resource allocation review where are we putting our resources as a district we did that
almost mids spring last year so that data is still relevant for us to consider the data we just added some
more data sources so while we may not be targeted for the same group groups um consider it a reset but we're not going
to go far from those goals that we established because they want to continue that work as they've said they
don't want to just start and stop and then turn their eyes to one thing and another so they would have used that
data and those goals from last year to inform their work for this uh spring
thank you yeah thank you um tag program review and parent meeting um this was great so as you know
our tag program is undergoing a program review where we just look at all components this is facilitated by uh the wonderful
staff at Heartland aea Kate Boonstra and Kyra Wilcox Conley are leading Us in
this work and I'm so thankful for their help um one one step in this process is
that we wanted to collect feedback from parents now one of the things I want to acknowledge up front I had a parent ask
a really great question it said parent meeting in the board agenda there are over 300 students in
that receive Tag Services we didn't have really the space or the availability that day to house all 300 so we ask each
building to give us a representative set of names like choose 10 that you think best represent your program and the
building so we had 31 people it was great and I know Nancy alluded to it um earlier that chance to interact with
those parents was powerful those that couldn't make it that were invited gave feedback and I'd certainly take feedback from anyone that that wants to reach out
uh but it's in relation to these bulleted items there as we ask them to think about it from a stop doing and
start doing kind of piece it's all feedback feedback is the Breakfast of Champions so you know there may be some
we can't do everything with every piece of feedback but we can find themes and that's actually going to start happening
during professional development on Wednesday of this week um I want to thank those families it was it was two
hours by schedule and I thought oh gosh we won't even fill the two hours we I I
think people weren't ready to leave at the end of the two hours um the conversation was rich so more to come uh
just for your radar we will ask the tag teachers and AA uh to come and give you
a quick brief overview of what we've done in that program review at the March meeting so should be excited questions
about that uh eighth grade parent night I'm proud of our Decap team and the high
school and Oakview leadership um I remember last year at this time sitting here and telling you about that and they
did nothing but improve that Pro that um parent night and using feed back last
year this year they got a little bit more wise and they kind of held them in their seats to get feedback before they
released them so I think they told me they had like 89 people give feedback which is excellent then you can start to
make some good decisions this is just that opportunity for them to understand what high school looks like what course selection will be um understanding the
course catalog so a really important step and I want to thank um Joan Travis
the assistant principals um just their building teachers that are there as well great night and and um I think an
important important part for us to continue our work with uh the district career and academic planning so
questions about that um District goals midyear review so
you have and I don't know if we're um it's in the I didn't give you the slides I apologize I just want to talk you
through uhu maybe he can pull it up on the screen if not I want to give you a quick overview of a midyear update I
don't we did not do this last year um but I think it's important as we have worked to um bring together the four
long-term goals think of it long-term shortterm and then our action steps so
the first slide that you'll come to is our long-term goals remember these are written um for May of 2029 that last
year it's about five years out um and and we we may reach them sooner than
later um but we're g to this is kind of that big picture of where we're headed and those big areas are improving
academic performance and while it lists uh and as I presented these to you earlier um how do we look at proficiency
and proficiency is one measure but it's an important one for us on isasp looking at exactly what our Middle School team
left exactly what our Middle School team talked about which was the mtss the multi-tiered systems of support process
uh as an administrative team and teacher team we knew that we had work to do with improving how do we respond for students
both academic uh and behavior-wise uh when they are struggling so we're going
to continue that work and I'll give you an update here in just a moment um increase those percent of respondents
who have um a favorable responses those positive ones on the conditions for learning survey which really targets and
looks at um how is the climate and culture in our building do they feel safe and and want to be a part of it so
we have goals there and then teacher efficacy which goes back to our strong framework so how do we help support
teachers um in understanding and they're already demonstrating it but even continue to get better better with
excellence in the classroom so those are our long long-term goals and then you'll see on the next slide short-term goals
and those are one year goals for us um in this case uh if you look at academics
increase the percent proficient on Ela and math and isasp um which hard to tell now I can't
really give you an update I can give you some action steps that have happened as far as data we wouldn't have that till
May um by May of 25 that we would have completed a study of MTS practices and
that actually starts for us on February 11th super excited to just our teams are all in different spots we want to honor
that you've heard that team right there they're moving and grooving we don't want to derail them what we do want to
do is talk about what do we believe as a district and then also how do they engage in those same conversations at
the building we have the conditions for learning survey so again helping measure how we our students feel safe and ready
to learn in school and then teacher efficacy that is that strong framework so the next slides just walk you
individually through some from I'm not going to read everyone but I want you to see that in regards to our academic work
some highlight there for us would be the implementation of new Ela curriculum materials including the my view and my
perspectives which is in grades 3 six and we also will be doing professional
development or have done on youly which is the University of Florida literacy Institute which you we use their
materials for early literacy the uh letters sounds um segmenting blending
and so farth math is in a year two of the curriculum cycle they have done an excellent job of working to meet to
Define what do we believe best practices um what does best practice look like in mathematics so we're working there uh
next year for them we'll be looking at instructional materials what instructional materials would be right
and then um the other is the Essa team learning and data review and sample test
questions so one of the things that the high school realizes um and Oak viiew and really all of our buildings is isap
T provides uh sample questions that have either been phased out of their tests
but we want to spend time with students talking about why the test is important how to approach a test question and it's
not teaching the test because nobody can see the test or have access to it um it's teaching about the test when you
get to a u whether it's a math problem or science how do we begin to break down
and find out what's the demand on the test taker what's it asking me to do so really cool work there as we look at
improving our proficiency uh next slide academic support uh this is that mtss tiered
systems of sports we hired Emily Donovan as a um consultant here to look at our mtss practices she has already evaluated
that districtwide and provided us feedback which has been critical because we did not want to make assumptions
about what was happening we also didn't want to step on toes to the point that we shut buildings down in terms of um
like well we've already done this work why are doing this again we don't want to do that we want them to have some
things to reflect upon so we're going to start that on February 11th and that collaboration has been um really great
uh Emily was a presenter on January 20th at our PD where she helped uh connect
the learning environment for us um goal three was the learning of the climate and culture goal so I want to
bring up that in the meantime the conditions for learning survey typically isn't given till April we don't have
that data yet um back to us but we have taken steps in the anti-bullying and harassment trainings uh We've trained
multiple staff groups across the district we've done I have a list some uh I could go over if you so desire at
some point um but we've given presentations to multiple grade levels we've presented I think to almost every
group of fourth graders we've presented to all fifth and sixth graders all seventh and eighth graders and are still
booking times I'm going to be going over to South Prairie to do some training there and then um we've done like our
activities Department staff coaches and students and then we're going to start really looking at building level work
this becomes that PBIS that they talked about the rules the structures scheduling how do we reward and
recognize positive behaviors so um continuing to help students to feel safe in our schools and then the last one
teacher efficacy um is what we've done there is we've collaborated with the teacher quality committee to review
strong that's our our committee that's half administrators half teachers um
asking feedback hey here's what we think for strong what should we add um we've heard from the strong facilitator out of
Arizona um kind of the consultant we've listened to her and gotten some good feedback there as a district we've
provided a PowerPoint to all of our coaches and principles so they can lead that work and then um just continued
collaboration so administratively we talk about uh what what it is we're presenting to staff before we implement
it so there's a high level of collaboration um the last two slides slides just show you these were our
original School Improvement Focus goals um I think we've worked very hard to address these um still provide dedicated
professional development time for every employee group um we already see uh Mr jusman who's out there and and I've
working to get feedback our professional development survey is out there right now with staff to collect big feedback
um we're going to continue with our curriculum review cycle that's been excellent um work there and then just
focus on those highight leverage strategies including the instructional framework so in the back page was just
to show you what our sample professional development calendar looks like as we build this for staff so um we want to
give you a midyear update it's hard sometimes in the absence of data we we would have opportunities uh in future
meetings to look at fast and um is as bait and we'll always bring that to you um but I hope you found this helpful
just to know are we on track does this stick with when you hear buildings talk about goals are we taking the right
action steps so questions about about that um so you said that the
mtss report is being put together by Miss Donovan yes um and that it should
be ready by February 11th correct or she will Begin work she's we are Fe the
February 11th date is our first administrative slash teer group so each
building is going to you know their administrator will be there and they're able to bring one or two or more in
individuals from the building so what we're going to start talking about is tier one and and the first phase of tier
one in terms of behavior is what do we believe about students and
behavior um we don't we don't necessarily have a district-wide belief system I don't think we're probably far
off but when we talk about all students can be successful you know we talk about
um you what do we believe that you probably students aren't trying to misbehave it's a way of communication
we're just going to start down that road of having conversations about when students behave um in ways contrary to
what we may be like what does that mean how do we understand it and also we'll we'll engage in an affinity diagram
where we kind of find out typically we find that groups will say well gosh If I Only Had the resources If I Only Had the
materials to to teach behavior and that that isn't wrong in fact that's very true but when you start to sort out what
drivers there are we find out that it maybe is more about a common belief system that we need to do first and then
we need to look at hey what does it mean for our buildings do we have common rules and Expectations by areas of the
building then down the road it gets down to resources so we're we're trying to help facilitate again we think if on
February 11th we model what the district process looks like for our
administrators and teams they can then go back to their buildings and decide if they want to do that same training maybe
they've already done that there doing really well and they want to move on to something else there's going to be some coaching components around helping
buildings well and Trauma informed practices don't cost money they're
practices right practices are free I was just more curious about when we as a
board would see that report that she put together yeah that would be we could do that at the next meeting we absolutely
could do that walk you through the summary of what she found um like I said it's probably nothing new but it was
probably good for us to understand um where we have you know highlights I would say would be we have pockets of
improvement so people wanting to things that have already happened so at building a they're way far ahead in
terms of we've had a process for a while other buildings are more oh we've had a change in leadership or something's
happen and we're a little bit further behind um I can show you the capacity Matrix that we're using to help people
reflect on best practice but absolutely you be able to do that at the next meeting that would be great um and I
know just from having been in the school some schools are Allin on PBIS and have
a robust program other schools do different positive behavior interventions and they don't call it
PBIS so just curious if this would also involve then more systematic approach to
how we Implement that PBIS system across the district yeah I think I said right over there at our admin meeting when
that very same question came up so um positive behavior supports and interventions right is more about that
the important focus of that that is this is Rules by area of the building this is
how we collect data this is how we reinforce those positive and address those negative behaviors that's PBIS
it's morphed and looked different over time people experience it all differently some classrooms may use a
restorative practices where they talk as a team about what Behavior looks like in the classroom and how do we help each
other learn together from each other um I you know other people might use What's um the safe and civil schools approach
which is Champs um Champs and stoic which is a framework that's an acronym
for how we teach and help students to understand what successful behaviors and
interactions look like in the classroom so what we know is students and I'd
argue adults too like routine and structure they don't always ask for it
but they like it and so those what we what we want to recognize is a school
that says if we come in and say you will all use this well I'm afraid we're going to lose
people along the way now we're trying to reduce variation here we're trying to make it so we don't have a thousand
different practices especially because we have four elementaries that feed into one Middle School the Middle School uh
you know their customers Oak viw and Oak View's customers the high school we're trying to make it so that kids don't
experience 15 different systems in one system but what we know is good for kids
and good for staff is in supporting tier one instruction you if you're the
principal at building a you may have something you and your staff really like and want to use I think if it shows
evidence-based practices and it's solid for students we would want to honor that um and maybe uh Meg is the principal at
school B and they don't have anything so they want to look at what you're doing that's great and Nick is at school C and
he uses something different that's fine but what do we need to be loose and tight on what do we need probably
shouldn't have 17 different sets of r rules then when we funnel to the Middle School everyone's confused so it's a uh
our principles have been remarkable um in the fact of open-minded wanting and understanding why we're doing this but
also we've promised them we're not going to we're not going to create an edict and send it down to the buildings um
because we want them to be a part of that process thank you yeah thank you any others about that one and then
last and most important state reporting state and federal reporting what been waiting for this I know have look at
them there're just so hey we certified winter SRI that is a major goal that is a not a small effort that uh has a lot
of people who help um Career and Technical education report where we identify what courses we teach by
program um our district career and academic plan you can just see we're working on that that's not due till
March and then our civil rights data collection and look at that number down there we are
98.93% done which just means I'm cleaning up the errors that are in there so um that isn't do till March 7th so we
are well well well well in advance of that so that's all I've got for
you all right Dr Bloom all right my turn building permits we will start with nine
in the district so that's a good sign keep moving up five single family homes were built kind of right over here where
opfs hanging out we got four Town Homes uh building permits you see two single
family now they're the that Willow Hills in Johnston so those technically aren't
ours but maybe they'll consider coming here and they know that process and then at this time no building permits in
December in Dallas Center but we are up nine so that's a good thing uh enrollment next so as of
January 24th we are down 19 students from October 1st our count dates that's
our kind of Resident students we're talking about now from month to month
from kindergarten optional through 12th grade we decreased by seven total
students in the past month 38 students moved into dcg and 45 moved out so
there's the the net minus 7 for the month I do want to emphasize this is
moving right these are these are families that literally have moved to um
in your packet you see 22 schools nearby 10 in Iowa five out of state couple
couple online charter school out of the country and four that did not share so these are not open enrollments that are
coming in or out of dcg at this time this is 38 moved into the district 45
have moved out a reminder board February 1 is our registration and for our
families this is critical for lots of reasons we're excited to know who's coming please get it filled out the
sooner the better cuz the registration like most things is going to dictate a lot of our next steps right with
Staffing where the sections at you know those types of things so appreciate everyone jumping on that as soon as they
can any questions on enrollment or billing
permits all right let's talk facilities and strategic plan so facilities um OPN
has been around in every building they have done their uh physical assessment of all of our buildings so they right
now they're working on that report they've also met with every rebuilding principle to kind of understand the
physical layout when it comes to education why do you use this space how do you use this space Etc so again they
will start to put um their thoughts on paper here in the coming months to give
us at least some sort of guide on what some of the district priorities um should be when it comes to our
facilities our first fac District facilities strategic our our planning
meeting is February 20th so that is a makeup of of board members
administrators staff and families that will uh again get to work with DCI and
OPN on again learning more about the district um and then give their input on
some of those priorities that uh they will be working on strategic plan we had Julie from Teamworks in with us last
week it's always fun to have her in so the strategic planning team met this past Wednesday at Oakview and we are
really now starting to put together a little bit more of the action steps lot
of listening lot of input um a lot of putting together kind of our theory of
action getting feedback on that so our teachers are currently in the process of giving more feedback on those the from
action steps but what we will start to see our next meeting in February uh on February 5th with the team and then as
the board will start to engage with Teamworks on some work sessions is really taking the ground up feedback
putting some action steps and then you will start to give your Insight on what becomes governments where are the
priorities with ultimately the goal at the end we want three to five kind of big District priorities when it comes to
our strategic plan with a whole bunch of kind of line items of how we're going to accomplish those tasks so it's been a
treat to have that strategic planning team proud of all the voices that have been in the room whether physically in
the room or outside surveys Etc so lots and lots of feedback and and more to
come any questions on facilties or strategic
plan okay just a reminder ISB has their annual day on the Hill tomorrow for a
couple of hours so um hopefully a couple board members can get there and meet with our legislators to talk about life
at dcg and how we could continue to use their support for us and public schools as a whole so appreciate those that are
um able to make it those that can't of course do not hesitate um to send an email to request to meet with them
one-on-one you have a powerful voice at the board table so there are lots of ways if you're unable to go tomorrow
that you know your your voice can be heard we appreciate you doing so on on
on behalf of dcg and public education state of the district meetings this has been a lot of fun for me just
kind of wanted to touch touch base with everybody so I have uh six of our seven buildings I got the high school in a
week and a half I've gone to every building 30 45 uh minutes or so and just a range of
topics I just wanted to talk shop about strategic plan facilities safety we've
talked about hiring process where we are with the budget kind of those types of things so just kind of talk and Shop
with them um had a little Q&A at all those and then they gave me a little feedback on did they enjoy the meeting
was it a giant waste of time what other topics do they want to hear from me on do they want to talk one-on-one um I
think hopefully fair to say that of the six so far uh a lot of very very positive feedback about being included
we just we appreciate the info and then I'll certainly take their other topics and find ways to get that in front of
them as well but been been neat for me to meet with all six staffs so far and then we'll do the high school here in
the coming weeks and lastly if I can refer our our
board and and those at home we're going to look at the calendar want to give a little insight on our calendar proposal for next year
so Dr Kenza has spent somewhere between the The Thanks goes out first U
somewhere between one and 100 hours on this calendar I will I will share it's a
little closer to the hundred it is fun to walk in his office and say Greg I think you've got an eye over there an
eye over there can you look straight at the screen please because it's all over the place looking at numbers and
calendar so he gets a ton of credit also our teacher quality team uh meets
monthly has just been phenomenal this is the group um that put all of this together last year did the surveys kind
of has taken the leap of faith to try a du calendar and and they're all in on this one as well they've they've had
input from start to finish so appreciate gra the TQ team for all of their hard work representing so many different
stakeholders so couple of Big Ticket items let's first um talk you can see we' bring new teachers in on the 12th
13th and 14th um all of our staff would come on the 18th and then we would start
with kids on the 25th uh maybe one of the questions you're going to have is hey what are we going to do if the the
legislature decides to address the fact that we may be able to start earlier this year when I met with some of our
Representatives I got the sense that that would just be a one-year um proposal that it would not
be a long term plus the fact that we're coming here to you today is because we
have so many moving pieces you heard how much great talked about our professional development schedule has got to be
started on now we meet with the AA in a couple weeks to talk about what do their partnership with PD Etc look like we've
got to get those dates in um around this calendar we know our families our staff
have plans they need to make for various reasons so um you know Greg and I leading TQ have shared with them and we
would share with you if they changed the calendar we probably would like to say thanks but no thanks like we're here
this is what we'd like to do for lots of reasons so if they move it we probably would say if others districts are
interested great but we like the plan uh we've got in front of you so we'd start on the 25th um keeping all of our our
Wednesdays I'll address that here in a second Thanksgiving break pretty
straightforward um the winter break there starting on the 22nd um I think it
worked pretty well the the full two weeks so we'd be be looking at the full two weeks again and we gave our staff
the flexibility on that Friday fe uh January 2nd they got uh the ability to
work um as they see fit over those two weeks so some came into the building some worked at a coffee shop some worked
on Thursday some worked on Friday I think they appreciated the professionalism because we know they're
working their tails off so we would we would follow kind of the same structure there um you can kind of see where're
we're ending quarters and terms critical that we align those up as close possible you know we don't want a
semester of 82 and another semester of 98 so we really try to get those uh
aligned so you can see how where those numbers match up I'll draw your attention please to February
27th and March 30th when we have teacher work days for
the most part the the four that are scattered around there's there's really three that I think kind of miror each other they really work for most of our
teachers um we certainly heard some feedback over the last handful of years that the 27th and 30th um 27th is really
maybe more k6 hey we're gearing up for conferences we got some report cards we like to do and 712 for the most part hey
it's a cool time we'll have a break we'll get some work done but in the past we haven't had one in March and the the
quick turnaround for the secondary team is at that March date the end of quarter three you know specifically at the high
school grades have to be due transcripts have to be completed new students are coming into classes that they just kind
of end on a Friday and everything starts on a Monday so what we'd like to propose to the board today is we would like to
have February 27th stay a work day for our k6 staff because they really need
that again for conferences and reort cards but we think it's advantageous for us to have our seventh through 12th
grade students stay in session then we go to March 30 where 7 through 12 as I
laid out would really find the advantage of that one day then our k6 six friends
would be able to stay in session so that would be two different work days it does not impact the end of the school year
same number of work days are there we would just have K six on one day 712 on
another to hopefully meet the needs of the students and the staff so we can ask questions on that but that's why you see two different work days um right there
and this would be an end of June 1 for our kids and June 2nd for
our staff that puts us a little over that twofold days so as we've talked
about we're doing hours so if we have a late start and early out because of
weather we're that's where we're creeping into but we have a built-in cushion of just under three day right
around two days so we would just keep track of those hours so we would not make up any school days or hours unless
we crossed um those barriers so that would be very similar to what we're doing now
um and then the Wednesdays okay so the feedback from our staff in a lot of
different ways has been very very positive let me be you know clear of course here we know no calendar is
perfect staff board families have lots of different ways of doing this what
I've gotten to see in here is we're now giv Associates the time that they deserve for training we're finally
getting El teams and tag teams together right we've got our custodians meeting we've got our bus
you know and our operations team meeting a lot in these days we've adopted the strong instructional framework this has
been for everybody this isn't just for teachers it's across the board these Wednesdays have given us time to do the
strong framework give buildings the time the PLC for staff um we Greg just sent
out uh end of last week that we're going to get feedback from staff on the structure how are the Wednesdays working
for you not you love them or hate them necessarily but we have a very clear process on week week one you know the
first week of a month this is what Wednesday looks like week two week three we followed the same structure for the
last six months and we'll continue to do so hey is that working for you has the content been relevant right do you want
more building and less District or vice versa we want teachers and staff to be able to say what's working and not to be
you know completely fair to the process we've just got to make some decisions sooner rather than later and it's not
good practice when we've made this change as we shared a year ago at this time that research tells us we we
probably shouldn't upset the apple cart one way or the other until we've done multiple years of this version we
haven't even done a full year of the Wednesdays so we absolutely want parent input we're going to get feedback from
other stakeholders but that may just look a little different than do you like it or not right now more of a are there
things we can tweak and improve on in a few years down the road now let's really
look at the data let's look at what the feedback says are we hitting some of the academic marks that we that we hope
we're having is our professional development truly increasing teacher efficacy and knowledge of our students
like I think over time we'll be able to do that but when we've got decisions to make families got decisions to make on
on their plans it's just prudent we get the calendar out as soon as possible so
please know we talked about the Wednesdays a lot lot of positive feedback certainly some areas we can improve I don't want any family to think
wait a second does that mean you're not listening to the the good and bad that I have about this no we abs abolutely will
we just think we're doing a disservice to the team and our teachers and staff if we don't at least follow through for
several versions of this over the next couple of years so all right there's my calendar stuff
Greg and I are here to answer any questions it'll be a new business item but you know if you have anything for me
now or we can wait as new business approaches any clarifying questions before you discuss a new business
okay so I can address questions as they come up Ryan I think I'm good m
wouth i direct your attention to the revenue and expenditure summary report for the month ending January 2025 noting
that uh we are 45.6 4% of expenditure
Appropriations for the year seemingly right in line with the last four years
also as we look at Revenue uh receipts uh through the same period is
47.67 per uh in comparison with the previous four years uh within
2% uh looking at the public budget comparison report remember this report
takes a view of spending in all funds as compared to what was published in the
certified budget uh to the patrons in the newspaper uh noting that at 58%
through the year each of the four areas are under 50% and at this time there is
no recommendation for amendment to any of those figures certified in the budget
last spring um fiscal audit so I am going to
take some time to walk through uh the fiscal audit that ended June 30th 20124
with you uh for those of you that have been on the board for a while you will notice that it looks completely
different than what we have been used to we have new Auditors beginning for the 23 24 year uh Bergen kdv they're a large
firm out of uh Minnesota uh we have been utilizing BM and Associates out of Pella Iowa and so
as with any new oversight they're going to look at different things look at
different practices and you'll see some of those uh changes reflected in um
what's in the audit report but I'm going to take some time to show you what the different pieces the different schedules
in the report do and as you peruse the audit what you should be looking at um
first of all on page 7 through 19 you'll find the Management's discussion and Analysis this is a summary of the fiscal
year written by District management it's kind of a synopsis so if you're only going to read a few pages 7
through 19 is what you want to hit looking at page 18 this is exhibit a or
the statement of net accounts this is a full acral statement and typical of what you would see in a business financial
statement not necessarily typical of what you would look at in a governmental public uh accounting situation so it's
sometimes a little bit misleading when we look at debt and fixed asset values however um it does take a very uh good
look at some of the um funds including the new nutrition fund and some of those
Enterprise funds not reflected here are any of our related entity groups wrestling club boosters fofa
Etc page 23 uh exhibit V is the statement of activities page and it
lumps all the funds in the expense column and Compares them to program revenues the amount that constituents
pay for services is listed here under charges for services that page is split
horizontally by government and business bus type activities hey Michelle sorry to interrupt but my document only goes
through page 13 I mean like I can print through Page
15 but like the actual document here only goes through 13 okay well we'll get something emailed
out to you thank you you might want to take notes then
and thank you for that I don't know why it didn't upload
fully um page 22 is the balance sheet for all funds the general fund unassigned fund
balance as listed on this exhibit is 8,510 uh
$510,300 that's a slight increase over the previous years 8,204 931 of
$35,000 uh on this uh non- major revenues such as the activity fund are broken down capital projects is further
broken down further back in the audit on page 70 Enterprise and nutrition fund as
well as student construction and farm funds are proprietary funds listed on page
75 in this exhibit you'll notice the self-funded Insurance Fund and internal
service fund uh they are listed there and further broken down further back in
the audit on page 31 page 28 is the combined statement of
revenues expenditures and changes in fund balance and if you want to look at a numbers page this this is where I
suggest you begin on page 28 you're able to obtain the revenue figure here and to
be able to calculate the solvency ratio with numbers already provided uh our
Revenue figure is 48 M83 $121 When you subtract aea flowr from
that uh you come up with 46,5
71133 and have the ability to compare um the fun balance to that and calculate
the solvency ratio our solvency ratio is 18.3 down slightly from 18.6 in the
previous year if you recall you took action as the board to Levy cash Reserve
at $2,519 311 in the FY 24 budget you
recouped about 95% of what we went into deficit for for special education ontime
enrollment L deficit Etc um that portion that you were
attempting to recoup was 2.6 mil 2,676
214 as compared to what you collected okay consistently using cash to fund
either enrollment growth or uh other deficits such as the ones I've just
discussed will place pressure on cash balance it's prudent for the board to
add cash Reserve Levy to replenish those funds whenever possible to maintain a
healthy balance be able to remain solvent during the dry parts of when Revenue arrives for example property tax
only arrives into two big chunks in the year Etc exhibit G page 31 is the statement
of net position for the Enterprise funds primarily this is the nutrition fund and the self-funded insurance funds this is
the fifth year of self-funding uh and we note a fund balance of $
5,914 th000 of fund balance I will note to you this is the first year of our self-funded insurance where our claims
exceed our Revenue so um page 33 gives you an idea of how
the hot lunch fund would function if it did not have state and federal funding I just mentioned that because it wouldn't
function without state and federal fun uh funding now I'm going to go through some
notes to the financial statements and for the first time standing in front of this board I have findings at least the
first time in 20 years so let's talk about new Auditors and um some of the
learning points and uh new challenges that I get to embrace
um so note 12 on page 56 restatements
and adjustments to beginning net position and fund balance are reviewed Construction in progress was understated
for the high school renov ation project and reported as an expense rather than completed in the tune of
$7,990 so in the audit they have readjusted moving that figure from one line to the other um they also note that
the ibnr which is the incurred but not um received claims in self-insurance
fund was slightly overstated at $59,000 so these restatements and
adjustments moving that from incurred but not re received in into expenses uh
are actual audit findings so these are accounting things that probably weren't
looked at closely in previous Auditors that now we're going to pay special attention to and make sure that we have
those right as we work with our new Auditors in their new processes
um comments uh other than that uh we have the segregation of Duties comment
in 20241 so I have not had a segregation of Duties comment from vanm and Associates
I think in about 21 years and um these
Auditors audit many schools across the country and noted to me Michelle
everybody as a segregation of Duties comment and so um I talked fast and still got the
comment so what that means is we are constantly in a state of improvement
looking at all of our process deciding where can we add a second set of eyes
where can we input additional internal controls and they have given me some of the things they would like me to look at
as far as internal controls and I will work towards that but frankly in an office the size of our business office
with five people there's just not enough hands to get full segregation of Duties
and so because you have put your full faith and fiduciary trust in Michelle
wouth that comment will probably exist uh for me or the person in my
chair oh that was hard uh 2024 prior period adjustments in
note 12 is the uh piece that I talked about where we moved uh that
construction uh in progress uh to from expenditures to Construction in progress
and also um other statutory findings
um by the time journal entries were done in the nutrition area we were overstated
by $2,173 in the N non-instructional area that's nutrition and so uh that is a24
in the comments and also h24 we had some audit adjustments to certified
enrollment uh for certified enrollment what occurs is we certify on a specific date we believe all those children that
we have on our audit are correct and then maybe another District has an eror
where the child lives in their district and we reported them or vice versa and
so those are audit adjustments reported to us later from the Department of Education that will also be one of those
things that consistently occurs and those aren't material weaknesses they
are just reported in that portion of the audit um finally uh deposit and
Investments uh cash balances in the bank uh investment accounts exceeded the
amount that the board approved in their resolution I think we had 15 million and they were at 22 million so if you recall
a few months after the audit I had you take a second action for Investments to raise that to 25 million so we don't
exceed that again so the board's already fixed um that plan uh for the new audit
I report to you that this is an unmodified opinion an unqualified uh those are good good
things um overall I'd say that the U process went very smoothly and we are in
a three-year contract with this firm and will continue to learn and improve product
Pro processes as I work with them do you have questions on the fiscal audit
before I go on
perfect moving forward uh I would like you to take a look at taxable valuations
uh for the budget year 2526 as reported by County Auditors you will notice uh
that between uh Dallas and pop County uh the valuation uh increase is
35,5 43,000 or 2.46% typically in all of our projection
models we use 5% so this is lower than what we had expected you will notice
that the Tiff tax in financing area is up 17.54% almost all of or all of which is
in pop County Dallas county is actually down in Tiff area by
14.76% and po County up 19.21% and then finally in debt service valuation this
is the amount that helps us calculate what we can bond for the district it also is the amount we used for PPP
that's 5.32% increase valuation are about 95 million that helps you as you look at
Future bonds or uh facilities for the district um to have that
capacity this will be used for the 2526 uh certified budget that uh I will
begin shortly um actually have already begun um and so I'd like to uh review
that timeline with you um if you recall there's two public hearing now as part
of part of the certified uh budget process and there is a calendar that
begins um on March 3DD with uh that being the date that I do my budget
presentation to the board and to the public uh presenting data and talking about the budget year and then uh you
will approve public hearing a subsequent to that uh then uh the County Auditors
will send public hearing a information to all residents on March 20th and we will hold a public hearing
on that on March 24th it will be its own separate meeting as required by code at
5:30 p.m. and we will have a regular board meeting uh to follow shortly after
that public hearing B uh will go to Dallas County news and be published on
April 10th and um or sent on April 10th published on April
17th and uh the public hearing in for uh
public hearing B will be on April 28th and the board will take action on
the certified budget for the upcoming year on April 28th we'll certify to the Department of
management on April 29th meeting the statutory deadline of April
30th do you have any other questions about that timeline
thank you Michelle uh we have no old business so we'll move along to new

early at the end of the second term looking for a motion move to approve

congratulations all those in favor indicate by saying I I post same sign
motion carries item e the 2526 District calendar Dr Bloom any additional
information here no hopefully I highlighted I know it's quick but uh any any questions you've got I'd be happy to
answer related to proposed calendar I just have oh a couple things one I
understand why we're doing the whole split K through 6 7th 12th my only concern is that you have kids older kids
that are watching their young younger siblings and I just have a feeling that's going to be an issue and we talk
about yeah people that don't have the facilities to take their kids somewhere else or the money to do that it just I
think creates a barrier for those families so just that's just my opinion I I I'm fine either way technically I
understand why it's good for the teachers I just look at that aspect of it um also I think going to June 1st I
just see a lot of kids not right on that day um so I just I understand where
where we get that place but if we take one of those days and just make it a full one you would right we end up being
back to that Friday but those are just my thoughts yeah Greg jumping any time we of course had long long conversations
about the February and March split date so it's it's a real issue we talked
about it so if that ultimately is a decision we need to look another way we certainly will our hope is is you know
board passes this today AJ is going to do a great job of communicating this
that's roughly a year right you know that this is coming hopefully people can
can make arrangements but we absolutely know that is a real issue and we talked about it at length and I would just
throw out there these are excellent points and agree wholeheartedly um chronic absenteeism you kind of got to
throw that in there because when we looked at finish before um June 1st that would have us taking two days going to
school in December on the 22nd and the 23rd we believe a lot of families would
also be gone during that time and thought missing I mean it's a little bit of lesser of two evils um I also think
one variable while we've been EXT please extremely lucky with no snow days no snow for that matter this year there
there may be a chance that if something like that happened a large snowstorm or ice we could be going past the first
anyways but I just I want to Echo uh Shay's concerns and you addressed The
Chronic treny or absenteeism concern that I did have but I and I know that we
had a public hearing for this specific thing I just don't know how informed the
general public is about that we're actually discussing the calendar sure
and so my concern would be that by the time they're providing input it would already have passed sure yeah and I I
don't want to certainly speak out of turn but AJ if this gets approved is going to communicate some of these big ticket items out and certainly if we get
a great amount of feedback that wait a second you just screwed up many of our plans on that double work date I mean we
can obviously come back to you all and and adjust a day and say we're going to
keep it keep it the old way so is there any harm in waiting a month like push
pause on this until February and then let parents like so then we don't have to retroactively
make a change it's a great question I would I would say if that is it's collectively the concern is just the
27th and the 30th that feels like an easier fix than a full month waiting and
now again Greg's pausing on the professional development we're pausing on our Heartland Partnerships so if
there are other concerns yeah that may be worth it but Meg I think if it's just that dat we can easily just say the 27th
is the work day we have school on the 30th and here we go okay y thank
you want to move us ahead just to get a motion on the table and then we can open discussion back up but I am looking for
a motion oh move to approve Dickson second be both all right any
further discussion I did have one question you
had mentioned that You' talked to a legislator and there had been some conversation about potentially allowing school to begin a few days earlier y I
wouldn't imagine we're unique in the fact that we need to get our calendar approved in this kind of time frame did
they give you any indication about timing as to when that might be approved and then why would it only be for a
one-year kind of situation yeah this L said that unsure of the timing just
knows it will be proposed thought it would be proposed at at the bill level um thought it might just be a oneyear
kind of fix because of where the fair Falls kind of kicks back to normal next year that becomes a lot there's not this
weak gap between um the fair in the the 23rd as
there is this upcoming year that it kind of falls back to normal so they thought a proposal would just be one year
doesn't mean there won't be more um also shared very openly
that he according to him the the fair maybe gets a bad R for that that there's a lot of other tourism that is impacted
and so he he could he saw there I could very easily see there not being a desire
to move it any earlier and and the statute stays the same
so okay and then I think we have amended
the calendar Michelle was that four or five years ago it feels
like we did amend a calendar like if there's something meaningful that happened um that we came back and we
said y yeah maybe we just didn't get it right and we did update it so I would say that that just as a a point to
consider is if there's enough um reason I suppose to update it
can come back before the board and we can amend it uh if we choose sure so
we're voting to approve it as it is but we want to consider what Shay said which I I like y but that'll be a different
meeting is that what we're voting on or vot on it as is right now
right yeah feels like we've got a launching point for a few things that need to get off the ground and then if
there's something new that you know whether it be around this split PD day
or whether it be around the ability to move some things back and get out of June I'm kind of in your Camp
Shaye feels like feels like we should stay out of June if we can yep
okay any other discussion all those in favor indicate
by saying I I poose same sign motion
carries um we've got a series of policies here
um the administrative updates some 700 series policies we've got some iasb
updates 1 four five and 700 series policies and then there's some five 700
series policies that were just up for uh mandatory annual review and then two 700
series policies that were reced around uh the school food program and uh 72.1
R1 the school bus safety instruction looking for a motion Mo to
approve Dickinson second that almost
exact any disc discussion all those in favor indicate
by saying I I post same sign motion carries moving along to item G uh
consider the contract for the director of student services uh first thing i' just like to
really thank Rox she's done a fantastic job for the district over the last couple of years and just really uh have
appreciated uh all of the the great work that she's done for the district but uh
I know um you know her time to retire has come and we also celebrate that and
so um I know the district's done some work here to um um put a new candidate
in front of us so there's um uh for your consideration the director of student services Allison
Finley uh with the 125,000 standard administrative benefit package for the
25 26 school year looking for a motion
Mo to approve Dickson second Baker Curtis any
discussion I have a couple of questions um I feel like um in the times previous when we have been asked to consider a
contract we have an addend or like um attachment thank you an attachment of
the contract so we can read that before we vote on it um additionally I noticed
that there's a $10,000 difference between what we're offering to Allison versus what rock is getting paid I'm
curious what the differential here is yeah great question sorry that the full contract it's the typical standard
administrative contract that have gone talks about vacation and stuff so sorry that that wasn't on there we'll get that to you so the difference is um we've got
a couple directors at that 135 level that did a tier they started lower and then after a couple years moved up to
that 135 rocks a few years ago was lot of history and her experience so our plan
with Allison is to start up the 125 and then tear her up to um at 135 in two years so roxs came in
with enough back experience sorry I'm not re sorry
you're not feeling well um so she came in with enough experience that she warranted that step okay yep okay thank
you you bet you any other discussion all those in favor indicate
by saying I I oppose same sign motion carries moving along to item h
uh hrf system agreement with Baker group uh this is a free consideration
agreement with Baker group to perform an engine engineering study on the HVAC system serving dcg administration
building for $4,200 looking for a motion is this is it a study or is it a preventive
maintenance agreement this one's a study there's
another one that's prevent okay that's down y That's the next one okay
yep looking for a motion move to approve MCN second Vander Feld any discussion
what are they studying well for $4,200 they can tell you if it's hot or
cold I'm going to maybe respectfully pass this one to yeah Ryan who's got a little bit more inside of the
construction of this place and some of the it's really struggles well the system doesn't work properly if we were
in here over the summer it was almost like the building was sweating I mean it had reached the due Point um if you
maybe were here a couple of seasons ago we had a bunch of coils that froze up and they had to bring an an ancillary
heating source and take a window out and blow heat in the thing just never has worked right and so there's a thing they
can do called retr commissioning where they come back in and and really look at the way it was designed to work
initially okay um and then they'll come back in and do some things to maybe some
enhancements to the system but then also um do a lot of calibration and fixing as
they go so it's a real labor intensive thing so it's largely labor I would imagine there's still some pieces and
parts in there but it's a pretty common thing when you have a system that just doesn't work properly okay thank you
okay the next one kind of goes with it can we discuss how do we have to wait till we get to the next point to discuss anything on the next one I just had a
question sure yeah let's let's clear this one and then we'll move on to that one that's okay with you any other discussion
all those in favor indicate by saying I I post same sign motion carries item I
Baker group preventative maintenance uh this uh for your consideration the agreement with the
baker group for preventive maintenance for the seven schools in the dcg school district including DC Elementary South
Prairie Elementary the Middle School Oakview dcg High School dcg auditorium
the admin office and this agreement is from February the 1st 25 through January the 31st 28 for an annual cost of
58,500 to be paid in installments $4,800 monthly looking for a
motion move to approve Vander second second any discussion do
they uh so don't they normally clean the coils twice a year in commercial
buildings um yeah I mean it depends um yeah what have we done in the past it
looks like this agreement they're going to do it just in the spring so if they come back in the fall we have to pay
them again we have to pay them extra to do the coil cleaning in the fall that's how I read that well they're
going to do one they're going to come twice but they're only going to clean it once it says for each building well and um so the coils the
difference probably is um those are all heat pumps so those coils are in internal so it's not they're not going
to be yeah so it's not like coils on a damper where you're you know you've got you know you're you're dragging outside
air across okay that's what I was thinking right and so in those instances you do this you're kind of taking party
tempered recycled indoor air that you know do carry the dirt load and those type of so once a year should be suffice
should yeah it's probably once more get today why is Heritage in North Ridge
cross toop so it's only showing yeah it's just
showing them all crossed off so I an exhibit a what exhibit a yeah on page
eight yes yes yes on page eight and exhibit a so are they under a different contract somewhere else are we not
servicing
them they have there's a strike through yeah
right I don't know the answer to that question I think when this I mean when I reviewed this earlier it came the only
caveat was um the old Meadows side that's got a set of heat pumps from a
very specific manufacturer that there's only a couple of people in town that can effectively work on them and until those
reach the end of their useful life we need to continue to work with that group so I know The Meadows part of the high
school was intentionally taken out of scope and that service agreement was going to stay with um the existing serer
and the rest of the properties we're going to go under a single preventive maintenance contract yeah so it says
that there are seven total of seven DC dcg schools but they have nine CU they have the admin office in
here and then they have the auditorium so they mean seven buildings under Baker the current contract with Northridge and
Heritage I forget the name of the company off the top oh so it is with someone else yeah I think they right now
are doing prevented M maintenance under an existing contract this is to get the other
ones on board we didn't is it through the same company or a different company it's a different company okay yep I just
don't know why we wouldn't together under the same maybe you get a better discount yes this is about our
relationship with Baker and their cost starting with these now seven buildings
as you can see where eventually maybe they will come under it once that other contract exactly okay yes yep so this is
sha shadiva and team Paul leading okay this piece there's an existing something that they they needed to maintain this
is about getting some schools we're just maybe the theme gang is
like need to do probably a better job with the prant side instead of like just reacting to when things aren't going
well or things like let's do a little bit more out in front so sh you know
Sean did his homework on getting good price price points Baker was the best for the contracts we don't have okay
sounds good thank you yeah thanks for that question any other
discussion all those in favor indicate by saying I I post same sign motion
carries moving along to item J the reconsideration committee Dr Bloom any additional information here yeah so I've
had you know in last December when we had this come up I I've had a lot of great questions come my way and got to
meet with some folks oneon-one so I thought it'd be best I know I get kind of rambly but I also have a little off
the cuff so what I did was kind of just put some great questions down so if you'll indulge me for just a few minutes
I'm just going to kind of walk through some of the major questions that came up our best to address those to you and and
certainly our public and then fire away other other questions um to start I want
to make very very clear that their dcg is going to be fully
transparent and open and honest with everything when I hear from folks that there are questions out there concerns
out there I hope you all know and continue to encourage our constituents and our public knows an email a phone
call a meeting goes a long way I will absolutely wholeheartedly meet with anyone that
wants my time talk to anybody that wants our time so I just need them to find me because I think there's some legitimate
questions out there that get posted online or they heard second or third hand that Miss information kind of gets
spread when I just want our people to come directly to the source I will always shoot them straight they
certainly may disagree with what I have to say but I I want no family member of ours to feel like they don't have access
to the right information I assure them I will get that to them um that is
integrity ethical transparency is what I'm going to do for them and for you um
maybe clarify a couple of things too dcg as a district is not looking to ban
books right we are not here to ban books that's a that's a a notot what we are
here to do though is follow state law and District policies that are set out if any parent or family member wants to
challenge it a piece of instructional material or a library book we're going to follow the process to a te okay so
we're able to to do both at the same time so I want to make very clear that
we will always follow every policy to a te and in our policy a parent a
Community member has every right to request a book be reconsidered by an appropriate committee and that's what
we're approving tonight we're not approving books one way or the other we're approving the committee that will follow District
policy so to address a couple things from maybe last last month Bloom what's
the difference between a board meeting and a reconsideration committee all right so the board simply approves the
reconsideration committee the committee is entirely in charge of the next steps
the logistics of the meeting are at the reconsideration discretion in a board meeting any public member of our
district may speak to the board publicly about any topic on the agenda this is just not the case for a reconsideration
committee the board approves the committee that meets in public to respond to open meeting
laws like any other board approved Committee in the district would be the same you often see work sessions those
would kind of be an example of that as well the committee is a representation of our public and of our teaching staff
we have one administrator who facilitates for the committee and is a non- voting member of this team they
meaning the reconsideration committee can ask questions of this administrator to find out answers for them they may
request people to speak at that um committee meeting they are fully in charge of the operation of the meeting
their dialogue is public there could be instances where the committee does not ask any individual to speak or ask
others to speak again that's their prerogative the audience in this case is simply that they're just the audience
they they are allowed to be there in public they just don't have a speaking portion similar to what you would see in
a board meeting when is time for deliberation and to vote on the challenged material or book that is done
in private right that is a closed part of the session the committee then will
send me their recommendation on the challenge book I then can agree or disagree with the committee's
recommendation I share that decision so my decision with the parent right in
this case and that person may choose to you know appeal my decision and in that
case it would come to you the board if the parent agrees fine if they choose
not to appeal then all of that is done just like that so I just want to clarify because I think there was some confusion
that this is going to be run like this it just isn't the case the six member committee runs it really how they see
fit Bloom why were there only 24 hours advanced notice of the committee meeting last month so we have incredible
Partnerships with our attorneys right and every we do I mean we pretty much
everything we do is is going to make sure it's run through them okay they represent a number of school districts
in our state their guidance around the committee notice to me doing the doing this for the first time is to follow the
same public format that you post other meetings whether that be special board
meetings or regular board meetings we typically post special board meetings 24
hours in advance and regular board meetings on Friday for the weekend in no way shape or form do we post
either one of those to hold back information to give people not a lot of time we we don't do it that way it takes
quite a lot for a board packet to be put together we kind of go up until the very end so our attorney said when it comes
to a public open meeting in this case a reconsideration committee you must post them in the same way you can't do more
or less for one committee than you do for another so that is why last month
following their guidance AJ posted our uh reconsideration committee for the
public the exact same way we post anything else the same number of ways in advance the same social media platforms
we didn't do anything more or less in that regard so I just wanted to clear up um that
question why was the meeting held at 4 o'clock this seems like a disservice to
our public fair question and I'm going to be brutally honest with this one that I hope doesn't hurt a lot of feelings
when this committee meets to do their to play their role the committee's time is the priority not the Public's time again
that's not an attempt to keep people away it simply is a a respectful time of
the six people that are volunteering their time three of which are staff
members and you know what a staff members day looks like they teach they do their thing till four o'clock I don't
think it would be fair to send them home to do their mom or dad thing or whatever
their personal lives to then come back several hours later because that may or may not be beneficial to more people in
the public again that's not a disrespect to our public who deserve to be in attendance this is clearly again the
committee's decision on what works best for them they get to pick the date and time and then we will and accordingly as
I just shared with our posting responsibilities do that so again I want to be no disrespect for the public I
hope that wasn't too rude R the committee's time will be the reason that
that time is picked during during a day okay the other question I got is what
happened the last time around why why are we even here again right so there was a challenge uh uh instructional uh
materials challenge that shanana Olsen who is our director of teaching and learning she is on this team she is the
non voting member administrator on this team remember three staff members three parents
uh shanana is our non- voting administrator she's just the facilitator we have a very specific process that the
board follows the board policy and that we then follow internally the goal again is to give everyone the most Fair
unbiased we're just trying to do this right we're staying right here neutral
okay we're not getting into the back and forth we're right here unfortunately our
process we're doing it for the first time wasn't followed as we we hoped it would okay there was no malice malicious
intent by anybody no one was up to no good just our internal structures we
didn't get an A+ I'll take the blame for that okay but because that didn't happen
to a t it was fair that we reached out and said do we need to do this again
with a new committee because internally we probably didn't have our aame the answer was Yes again I trust all of the
six people last time they are wonderful staff members and parents but to make sure we have the most unbiased Fair
process I thought it was best that we pause and do this again when I found out
that the stuff that we were trying to hold so tight just didn't happen and again I'll wear that that's on me so
that is why this group is here it is not because of public outcry to be honest
it's not because we did anything wrong quite the opposite I think dcg has done a lot right in this our attorneys would
share we have done a lot right in this but that is why we are here today I just want to make sure the policy is followed
correctly and internally we take the right steps to do Justice by all members the committee the complaintant and the
public um again great great partners with our attorneys um throughout my time
as I shared I've tried to follow their guidance I brought their guidance to you as my bosses and we we've really done a
nice job of sticking with their guidance um they were involved every step of the way last month and this month as I tried
to learn and and do a better job with this um again we followed state law we'
followed board policy and any internal thing again I will take the blame but I
want you as um our board to know the representatives our constituents in the
room and public there was no shadiness unethical quite the opposite we wanted
to do it right so we thought we should pause and and try this again okay I will always do everything with high integrity
and high ethics that does not mean I get it right doesn't mean people are not allowed to disagree please do right but
that should I hope will never be questioned is the open and honesty of every of anything including put putting
together a reconsideration committee based on state law and District board policy to reiterate no one is looking to
ban books at the same time we have a duty to anyone in our community that has
every right to reach out and follow this process and we will do it the right way for them so I appreciate you letting me
again I didn't do a good job of not rambling but I want to answer any questions that you you have I want any
parent and Community member to reach out to me directly I will take good care of you when it comes to any question about
anything social media can be awesome it can also not be awesome when I think sometimes our questions go there and
this back and forth instead of I wonder if we can just reach out to bloom and
understand about what happened there what are we doing moving forward on any single topic I not told a single parent
no that I won't meet no I won't answer their phone call so I hope that's the Learning lesson and all of this is how
we got here and that ultimately any mistakes were made I will wear them but
I want our families to know I've got their back and I will take good care of them even if the topics are tough the
questions are hard I will meet them headon and we will do this together so hopefully that answer some of that but I
I want all of your questions to be heard as we do this the right way thanks Dr
Bloom you got um so for your consideration the listed uh proposed membership of the reconsideration
committee based on regulation 6053 R1 looking for a
motion move to approve MCN
for a
second I'm I have a question about the procedure here because I have some questions and I was hoping to be able to
ask those questions um and I'm not sure if asking those now before the second is
appropriate or if it's appropriate to wait until after the second we need to
have a motion before we have discussion and that the motion needs to be seconded okay second F any
discussion um yes so one of the questions that Dr Bloom brought up um
that was proposed by the community members that you spoke with was around the 24 hours notice um and I know back
in December I had made a request to this board to be able to receive some of the information that we're going through
whether it's these packed board agendas or work um session information more than
24 hours in advance and I'm not talking 72 hours but just a little bit more time
in everyone's busy life to be able to thoroughly review them um as you said
people have busy lives uh things that they do outside
so that is something that I think as a board would be who us to discuss whether
it's in terms of this reconsideration committee or future board meetings
moving forward um I respect the fact that the staff that you have here is a
small staff wearing many many hats um and that putting together those
materials is quite challenging I take my role here on the school board very seriously and I open up every single one
of those documents and I look at all the bills and I read and I up look up the policy numbers because I want to do the
job that I've been elected to do and so I would just encourage us as a board to
have that discussion at some point um one of the questions I have is um at a
system level what at what level do most challenges occur do those most
frequently occur at the elementary the Middle School the junior high or the high school great question uh so my 18
months there there was one challenge that was at the secondary level and what I should have done Nancy so thanks for doing this is sharing that a parent has
every right to do that immediately however we as a district right our
philosophy is we want to stay at the ground level as long as we can so certainly encourage any parent that
they've got any questions reach out to that classroom teacher to learn more maybe reach out to the librarian to
learn more reach out to the principal right shanana Greg and myself we are all
here because there are lots of different ways that we can handle things and again I want to make clear to to you and to
the public any book right that is a piece of our curriculum if anyone is
uncomfortable with that the book is not the curriculum the book is not the standard is a resource to Resource to
learn the standard therefore we will always work with students and families
on other type of text literature Etc that can meet the same standard if
they're uncomfortable with this book that is always an option so please know that again as you talk or address
question we will always work with people to find how does a text help the standards
because the books are not the standard so but in my time the answer we've just had the one and is at the high school
level and so can you clarify then for me the role of the teacher librarian on the
committee yes so they are just we have to have one by board policy a single
librarian in the district that is a part of the the committee so their expertise
is is important their knowledge is important but they are one of six when
it comes to the dialogue and in voting what level is the teacher
librarian that is on the proposed reconsideration committee Elementary and we've had how many
Elementary books challenged we had any the so there in lies the question I guess yes like um if I'm going to bring
some um expertise to the table wouldn't it be prudent to to kind of lean more in
in that age group sure y um what I what
I tried to do when reaching out to people is there is a range of the three staff members we have an Elementary
staff person who happens to be the librarian we have a middle middle school staff member Austin Ricks as a teacher
and then Lindsey gaser Bauer is an instructional court at the high school so that is trying to get three different
pieces of of representation again a librarian through Shana as the facilitator any of those people can ask
questions can you find us this information how does this work um they don't know the I would assume some
parents probably don't know the curriculum review cycle as an example well they could ask that question and
then it's shanon's job do you find the people that can find that answer she can deliver that answer they can get that
information in the public setting um behind the scenes before they dialogue
the questions go to Shana and then she facilitates and gets the answers that they're looking for so in that case may
maybe a Elementary um librarian may not know about a said book she certainly has
every right to ask I would like to know these questions sh I will work to get those all members the the same answers
to to that question is it expected that that channel will be fielding all questions related to research on the
topics or are committee members encouraged to do their own research no committee members need to go through
Shana with that research so they would say I want information on X or I've I'm
seeking information because that needs to go to all six committee members it would not be um part of our expectation
that any committee members feels like they need to go on their own to find information we can help them with that
and be any of that information should be available to all six members not just to
themselves so then the idea that any of these people would bring any sort of expertise to the table is kind of moot
right if they're getting all of their information from Shana and it's all going to be the exact same across the table well when you said looking for
research so well right so like if I have questions about a text or how how my discussion is going to be um prudent
right right um I I would personally think that it would be important to have
a variety of of input right because that's how you have worthwhile conversation corre if we're all
operating on the exact same data points and not bringing in anything that we have that we individually bring to the
table well then I don't understand why it would matter whether or not these people are staff members or community
members or administrators cuz they're all getting the same information absolutely yeah yeah I would just respectfully say that if the the
knowledge I already have is coming to the room and I'm going to share that if I'm seeking research on
X I would want that information then shared with the rest of the committee
through shanana who is again the sender of info so that they're not just
necessarily finding out in the reconsideration setting when we have ways of getting that information ahead
of time it's not about keeping it secret it's about hey I have questions on this
I would like information on that how do I make sure I stay in the bounds of what the committee is able to do and get that
same information to all six members not just to myself it the all the questions are valid and anwers should happen we
just need to make sure with Shana's leadership as an non voting member she kind of gets to oversee everyone's got
the information are we staying within what we're looking for do you want does the committee want to have people not
she's got to send that out to everyone so we can't have someone kind of just doing that on their own they've got to work with shanana so
all six are getting the same piece of information the same next steps on the heels of that I'd like to
reiterate ny's question from the last time we talked about a reconsideration committee which wasn't that long ago um
and how were these people selected yep so I reached out to shann and I met in a
room together we talked about a number of Staff members we think would do a great job for us folks that have you
know reached out and said we'd like to serve in any capacity so we did that and then we came up with a list of names
between the two of us of families um family members that we think would just
do good work for this process there was not a lot of other input to be honest if
people have reached out to me and said I would like to serve on this committee I appreciate it I did actually include
them in this why because the number of times that they reached out to me followed by their belief system on
reconsideration committee so a typical email would be Bloom I would like to be on this committee I think it's in
appropriate that dcg is Banning bucks I don't want any side to be represented
one way or the other I want as unbiased a group as we can with the six so when I called these individuals I said here's
your role here's what we need I don't need your politics I don't need you tell me if you read or not this is what I
need from you and and they agreed so why was the last committee
disbanded I as I shared M there there was impropriety but not impropriety cor
can you expand on that a little I want to be I want to be respectful of the the individuals in the
room so I will just say internal practices were not followed but based on
the fact that this is a board policy that they're supposed to be following and reading the board policy I think
that it's prudent that we understand what board policy was not properly impacted yeah or enacted yeah I just uh
I will I will share if you and I want to talk one-on-one we can we were the the expectation of of the team and how the
committee will be run and and how that will be followed was was not adhered to
and so we needed to have a new Committee just to to make sure again there was unbias in the
process I have some questions we talk about transparency and I know that the books originally were not
released the titles correct and to my knowledge that there is no law stating that we can't release those um I know
that that probably creates some Social Media stuff happening but I feel like that actually almost makes it worse when
we don't release that information sure um because I feel like that's a right for them to know what books are being challenged whatever stage it is but I
think in the beginning actually personally and I don't know if that's a board policy if that's Administration
um but I'm just curious like how does that come about like is that something we purposely tried to keep away or I
mean what were the I guess reasonings behind that yeah so again and I just I'm gonna give a little grace to the fact
that this was the the first time with this the committee gets to decide what
information they want and who gets to be in the room so when we were talking about confidentiality of the
complaintant we agreed that what needs to stay tight as well is what is being challenged until the open public meeting
if we decide as a committee and I'm not on it so I shouldn't say we if the committee decides we want additional
information or we want to share publicly what is being challenged as long as said complaintant remains Anonymous that is a
route that that group can go down but the committee again has every right to say no one will talk everyone will talk
so we attempted to do our best with confidentiality again not trying to not get people to
be involved in the process but people are just observers and at the time we just
decided for right or wrong let's we we don't want any of this information to get out in worry that we
then would affect any of the outcome the safety or unanimity of the complaint it
we absolutely the books to give that away just so that committee chose to for
this for this instance they chose to keep those two books under w the committee Shana Shana and Scott said
we're going to keep This Confidential until they open public hearing from attorneys anonymous anonymous anonymous
if that's a Learning lesson for us that we don't have to name then fine with the committee can decide moving forward if they want any of the books public they
would need to figure out why because they are representation of families it's not just like you they represent the
people it's not 300 people coming in and sharing their input their job is to
represent well so if you do have a public for and we're only giving 24 hours notice it does not give them time to research that book personally I mean
I know that they don't have a say in it but still I just I feel like it's a transparency thing for me like I just
feel like we really need to be sharing as much as we can and I don't see any harm in that that's just my personal opinion and I get that that committee
has that say it's maybe something that we need to look at yep um and I think that's fair I guess what I what I want
to do is protect the committee and now that our obviously our committee members are public right this why you
vote so now I put this challenged book out there what I just want to make sure
for their sake is then they just don't get peppered I'm not allowed allowed is
the wrong word maybe the committee doesn't seek a lot of other people speaking at their open meeting I don't think it
would be fair to the committee when all of this is public 72 hours in advance here are the books then all of a sudden
people find ways to Pepper them with st because I can't speak to you but I'm going to email I'm gonna again I I hope
that doesn't happen I don't mean to go to worst case scenario but part of the decision was we're trying to insulate
the committee as best that we can not from obtaining information but doing it
together in the same way with Shan's leadership that would be my concern but it's certainly something we can do if we
think that's a better process so when the challenge is received yep is there a
time frame that they they have correct okay can you explain just kind of what that time frame is so people know y I
guess what what is happening yeah yeah so typically they do that at the building level so a complaintant would
fill out our our district form turn it into uh the building principal who has five days then to return it to me and
our window of time and we would work with the complaintant around their schedules but typically it's a two- week
window of Shan gets the team together she goes over the book here are the
steps of the process remember if you have questions here's how we do that so 5 days kind of on the front roughly two
weeks before they're expected to give me a recommendation I then in turn have a timeline to let the complaint it know
they have a window of time to appeal to the boorn if they choose okay and that's usually just one book I know this is
like two is it typically usually one book typic yeah I think typically it was one book historically around us in this
case they were similar instructional materials that that we agreed it would be best to do those at the same time to
more of a timing thing for the committee okay y thank you to speaking to insulating the
committee are there other committees that you bestow this insulation on that you look to protect from the general
public I don't think I'm protecting them from the general public I don't know what you mean makeer you said that you wouldn't want them like by keeping the
title secret or keeping them like under reps and that was something that you and Shana elected to do this time it wasn't
something that the committee decided to do you don't want them to be peppered with information you don't want them to get emails you don't want them to so are
there other committees that we try to bestow that same courtesy to I don't have that example no okay thank you yep
I think as a board we need to be careful and mindful of obviously we want different opinions and we all believe
that people need to be kept safe and so when I think about us saying we're going to post this 72 hours we're going to
give all this time what I've seen in the community is kind of some just negative
defamation type of things against someone because they don't like their opinion so if we think about this
committee as a whole and the way statute was developed it's supposed to be as unbiased as we can get it that's going
to be hard everybody has an opinion but when I think about a complaint in any sort of the way bullying whatever I
think the idea that we trust a committee to take care of that isn't outlandish I
also think that if the public doesn't like that they don't get to be a part of it they need to realize that they're
there to observe anyways so if I'm a committee and I'm getting ready and I'm uh one of these people that's on the
committee and the news gets called and all these other people get called and all this stuff goes out in the community
if I'm the person that said I don't feel comfortable with this I'm already coming to this meeting going I I don't feel comfortable I don't like this the people
that are supposed to make a as unbiased a decision as they can they're going to be in the meeting going what's going on
here and I think we have to be careful because what we want to come to the table on our community members is a safe
place where they can come and say we don't necessarily agree with this and at that point if the people don't like it
they can still come and come to the board and that's the Forum where the community can come and speak but I think
we need to be very careful because there are a certain group of people that don't like somebody in this specific instance
but if you flip it around if those people called their people I think we just need to be very mindful as a
district that when somebody comes forward and says I don't feel comfortable with this we don't say we're
opening it up to everybody and everybody has it we have a we have law here we
have a district policy that we're following so we just I just want us to all just be careful because the fact if
we go down and we start peppering well what other we start going down this route if I'm somebody that feels uncomfortable in the district I'm going
I'm not even going to complain anymore I'm going down the road to this place because they don't have this issue and
what we want is more voices at the table not less and so I think we just need to be mindful when we think about this take
away the left and the right and all that stuff and just say if I'm a parent and I feel uncomfortable with some sort
of material what do I want that meeting to look like do I want that meeting to
look like a okay we got these sides and everybody's getting entrenched when all of those people are observers or let the
committee play out this we haven't even had a book be reconsidered the full process hav so no one even knows what
this is going to look like and so I think we just need to be mindful from what I've seen in the community the last thing we need um is our community to to
be known as a community that we don't like your voice if it's this voice and
each side would agree that that's the thing so I just want us to be mindful the idea that somehow the entire 300
people need to be at a meeting in which they have zero capacity to affect that decision the only reason you would want
to be there is to somehow I want my decision to go this way but you're not part of that and so I just want us to be
mindful on both sides that we just respect because the last thing we want are parents in our district feeling like
they can't come to the table because is before some of the other people were here the feedback we got from the district is you don't listen to us we
want our voices to be heard we want our voices every single survey that we do every single thing we do we want to keep
everything private we want to respect the individual's right unless it's something that I don't like I just want
us to be careful and I think we we need to just understand that there's a lot of emotions that play on both sides but I
think we we need to just pause a little bit and understand that I don't see anything good happening when we try to
we're going to get make sure everybody can be in the room but they're not part of the decision-making process and so if
somebody doesn't like somebody on the committee have a conversation but I just we need to be careful because this
escalates into something that doesn't look good for our district and it doesn't look good for the person or the parent that says I don't feel
comfortable with this they have every right to do that and they have every right to go into that space feeling safe
and feeling like they're not going to be attacked and the idea that well they wouldn't be attacked it's I've already seen it and so I just that's my little
two cents but I just we want we need to respect both sides of this and create as you know a neutral of environment as we
can so I appreciate what you've already said and I think you know mistakes and things like that are going to happen
this is all new for how many districts right um but we need to be mindful as a district that I would rather have more
voices feel comfortable coming to this thing and saying I don't like something than silencing those voices because I
don't want to get the backlash or have this vetted or I just we just need to be careful I think I'd like to correct
something I never requested 72 hours notice in fact I said the exact opposite
I said perhaps 24 to 48 hours and I think in all of the surveys that we send
out and we request information we allow parents more than 24 hours to be
informed upon that I recognize that parents aren't going to have an Avenue
and this reconsideration committee to vocalize their opinions but I think we do have due diligence to inform our
community members in a timely manner when these sorts of conversations are happening I respect the individual's
right to challenge any curriculum I'd like to clarify we have an extensive
curriculum review and selection policy and that policy to select text to align
with curricular standards does not happen overnight or in a vacuum but but
receives feedback from multiple members within our very highly qualified staff
um was this family or Challenger provided an alternative text to these
two texts and an alternative assignment that their said child could participate
in as an alternative to the curriculum that would be for the majority of the
10th grade yes and was that alternative
selection chosen by the parent yes and so this is really about limiting these
options for the 99% of parents that did not challenge
this I don't want to speak to any complaints intent but yeah we worked
individually and again as policy they have they have a right to continue to challenge if they don't see it's fit so
but I don't want to you know certainly guess any intention to my
recollection anybody in the community can come and suggest that something shouldn't be here right or is it only a
parent no I mean the policy says parent or Guardian parent guardian of a student in the district okay but does it say
whether or so I think we just need to be careful does it say whether or not if they're given additional or other means
then they still don't get a reconsider it does not no okay so that yeah okay that's all I want to make sure and our policy says that we must distinguish
between broad Community sentiment and attempts to impose personal standards
correct so again we offered an alternative and that alternative was
selected and yet this material is still being challenged and I understand our purpose here is to approve the committee
um on the previous committee we didn't have an elementary representative corre
why was the decision made to include an elementary representative this time just
getting new new members on just looking at who was on there and trying to find different representation
so what is the alternative to the board approving the committee so you're you're only
approving the district committee there's no complaintant I have right now there's no this is simply yes I mean yes and I
have shared with the committee they this goes through the end of the school year they would have the right that I would
speak with if they want to continue next year but by August we will have similar names or brand new names because we have
to approve this every single year and in this case we just did it in December my mistake for not doing
it earlier so that's why it looks funky that was in December it should be a
August thing that you all approve in advance for the school year year and will we have some sort of a board work
session to talk about the selection process I know that was something I personally reached out to you not just
for this committee but for committees in general and I think as a parent stakeholder that process just isn't
clear you know some committees I know Greg has said come beond the wellness committee we want everybody if you're a
kid come here and I know you've had individual community members reach out to you specifically about this committee
is there some way that we can work together as a board to develop some sort of a policy or system for these
committees are invite only these committees are personal selection by the principal these committees are
application process because if you're a parent who is deeply invested in our school Community like so many parents
are in dcg I think that they would want to know that process I know I had folks
reach out to me and say why didn't I get invited to the tag meeting yeah that I number one I think
Sak is board approved so please know we bring all of those names to all of you for approval that process is we ask
principles to identify several people in the building that may be interested they they may contact 10 and only hear back
from two I mean sometimes I'm like oh there's not more um I know people are busy but we bring that to the board um
the teacher quality committee which is another I'm trying to think of all the Committees that I work on to represent
that is also um board approved we bring that uh early in the year it has to be by state law it has to be a mix so
Wellness you're correct we take anybody at this point I mean the wellness is our
way to get as much input from different groups I I feel bad I I um I don't know
every family in the district just in my short time here so I often rely on kind of the casting a a line and then seeing
who can get me names um I apologize the way I wrote it in the board report about the tag committee we did consider
inviting all 300 parents and and that would have been fine the auditorium was not available due to some practice um
the Mustang room was not available because they had a meeting in there we don't have a location should 200 of
those 300 have shown up we didn't have a location so again not hand selected by me hand selected by teachers of the tag
teachers that represent I hope uh I'm I'm trying to think of other committees we might use in our district one of the
things that I think we heard ironic from parents at the tag committee was kind of along the lines of what you spoke
earlier thank you for the opportunity to give feedback but it's not a committee
that necessarily it's not a committee it was a chance to interact with parents one of their feedback pieces in that
meeting was we would love some learning ourselves about tag and you know
learning from an expert hearing what we do to challenge our own children that to me isn't a committee as much as we might
form a tag parent night or tag parent University so I I think the question is
really well suited as we work to increase parent communication and parent interactions Brandon alluded to that a
little bit of wanting to get input from people I place a high value on that because I don't want to make assumptions
um I mean I can certainly help in putting together something about how they're Chosen and how they're approved
um but some of them seem more open to others but I want to be upfront that I can't think of others I mean like we
have some um maybe would do a BLT or a DLT meeting which would just be
Representatives where we'd ask principles to choose uh but I uh I do
try and think that when we've done Even in our PD calendar and our Wednesday schedule try to make a conservative
effort to make sure that we have voices heard from multiple stakeholders it's not perfect but we want we I mean I
believe in that because it helps us to make good solid decisions I just know that we've spoken
and I've met with you Dr Bloom um and talked about about this how we are just constantly seeking as a district and a
system to increase that parental involvement you know we can't always have parents in the classroom work
schedules are busy right but what we know is that our stakeholders are truly dedicated to our our buildings um and to
our district as a whole and so I just think if we could provide them with a way that was articulated clearly and a
and a spelled out process we would see that increased enrollment that we saw
off after after Co and I would just encourage that I mean I would love as a special education parent I would love a
special education parent University or parent night I I know many families
would um about all of the great things that we do here you know we have so many
great athletic nights and Fine Arts nights it would just really behoove us to consider that process we've shared I
think at Sak 2 if you remember the nine characteristics of a high performing School District um in that we know I
think it's number nine it shouldn't be last by Nature I think it's just number nine is um parent participation and I
always think there's a direct correlation between parent participation and the the um health of of a school
organization whether or not that becomes a district goal down the road um and
constant dialogue and discussion with our administrators and teachers about how do you seek parent feedback and and
opportunities to help them in the room I I think that's an absolute goal we should have so Dr Bloom
yeah hypothetically let's say the board doesn't approve these members they could still be appointed by you correctly if
I'm correct it just would be it would just be them meeting is that correct no right now our board policy dictates that
this has to be approved before the committee can actually hold its case
there are others that there's not board approved committees for example that yes then we can can just pull together for
different reasons but if District policy states that the board approves the committee we then need to have that
committee approved Before The Next Step can be and you said that there's not an active complaint right now so that has
been withdrawn or resolved in another way I yep when meeting with this um
parent to talk about our steps from December to today they have every right to to refile to refile with the brand
new committee but okay yep until the committee is formed there are no existing complaints
okay there's a couple things I think um that come to mind you know first we
adopted the policy Lock Stock and Barrel from IP we didn't modify it um I I live
through a season on the board where we tried to wrestle the uh reconsideration
committee uh policy to the ground and tried to work as a board I think with with good intent there just a lot of
different opinions I think the law is more clear today than what it was then but uh living through that prior
experience it was pretty clear to me that adopting the policy is it was written by iasb that was you know as
close to as they understood the spirit of the law as we could I I felt like was
an important step for this board to take and that's this board is the board that voted that policy in which I'm proud of
that and I think that was good work I think the second thing is there's times where you know the board um
intentionally gives the responsibility uh of something and a lot
of times it's a lot of things to our administrative team whether it's Dr Bloom or Dr Kenza or
others and and when we give that responsibility through policy as we've done in this case we you know if if there's
conditions by which we want that work to be done we need to state that in the
policy if not that means that we're extending that trust and that confidence
that that those committee members are going to be effectively selected and and that we're we're really
giving the trust of the board to those people that have been given that responsibility so I I think I think
that's important um there's a lot of ways a committee can be formed but I think just on the on the face of it I
trust Dr Bloom I trust Dr Bloom and his staff to go out and assemble the right committee if he's telling us that hey we
we just had some things not go right with the last one and we need to reassemble it I understand that I appreciate that and I think that um
that's that's what our job is here as a board now if the policy comes up for re-review in the future and we want to
you know take that up as um a conversation again on on different uh
criteria I suppose we could do that but that's what the policy says that was the spirit of what that was intended to
do um and I I think that you know from my perspective that you
know um the until we at least get a perspective on whether or not the policy
works or whether or not the committee selection works and until we can test it and understand that there's something
broken with it or not it's kind of hard to understand exactly where we ought to
go with it so I just just from my perspective I I I don't see an issue
with the members that have being put forth uh by Dr Bloom I don't see any issue
with the way that they were selected um policies written not by us it wasn't
formed by this board it was written by ISB um in in reaction to the way that
they read the new law is there other
discussion so it says that the policy was last reviewed and updated or adopted
by us August 28th of 2023 how often do we review
policy so um some iasb identifies some is a mandatory you need to do every year
I do not believe this is one of them I'd have to check so I don't want to miss I can get you that information curious it
is best practice to have and why you're seeing so many policies coming at you is
it's it's best practice to have updated those at least once every 5 years if it
extends beyond that we're not out of compliance or out in violation it just just means our information may not reflect best practice so we try and and
Michelle feel free to add if I misspoke on that at all in the event that we would like to
revisit that earlier what is the procedure to do so sure yeah I mean direction to Dr Bloom and and to this
team and we can certainly we do have um we have a Cadence as I say where every
month so what comes to you is through those kind of combing through as we say hey um something's come to our attention
maybe um an address uh we've learned that an address has changed maybe it's a compliance issue so there can be any
reasons why we would bring a a policy back up for consideration and that would be your direction if it wasn't something
that I mean you're 100% right yep make if anyone on the board wanted to to talk about any policy whether it's in a onee
five-year cycle we absolutely can put it on the the first reading piece and have discussion and do a second reading that
can happen at any time okay thank you you bet other discussion
and clarifying the process would not be an adoption of policy right like providing information to parents or to
stakeholders about how those things are done is not adopting new policy it's just providing information
correct just to clarify you mean if if a parent ask why did you do or like how
how do you get on this or what is the steps to we're not establishing policy
and doing that we're simply providing information as Jaye mentioned before and in good
faith transparency right and to have that discussion here at this table in
public purview would be our our moral obligation and responsibility correct
corre so our Schoolboard policy says that we appoint the committee yep is
state law different we approved the we approv the committee is is state law state that the superintendent points to
the committee no is there any no there's no we're all in the same correct no no
state law directly into the committee State policy okay just okay it it was
recommended um through the IB draft that it' be done that way
okay I do have one we received an email I think all of us received that today um just asking about seeing more diversity
on this list I don't know all of these people but just something to keep in mind down the road sure thank you let
people know that someone is paying attention and seeing that so
