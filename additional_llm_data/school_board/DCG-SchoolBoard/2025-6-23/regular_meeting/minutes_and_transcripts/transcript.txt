2:31
Good evening, members of the board. My name is Will Rubil and I'm a resident of Grimes. I'd like to share a concern
2:38
regarding the upcoming vote on the facility use agreement with New Hope Assembly of God, specifically regarding
2:44
a potential conflict of interest involving board member Brandon McNace. To be clear, I have no reason to believe
2:52
Mr. McNace will disregard schoolboard policy 203, which outlines the need for recusal in the event of a conflict of
2:59
interest. I trust he will act appropriately. However, because public public comments are heard prior to the
3:06
board's discussion, I feel it is important to raise the matter now. According to publicly available records,
3:13
Mr. McNace and Mr. Zach Hill, the listed point of contact on the agreement are
3:18
both members of New Hope Assembly of God. They also serve as officers of the
3:23
same nonprofit organization as confirmed by the latest filings with the Iowa
3:29
Secretary of State. Additionally, New Hope Assembly of God has actively
3:34
promoted and raised funds for their nonprofit. While this may not directly
3:39
impact the facility use agreement itself, transparency is important. I
3:45
noticed that public representations made by their nonprofit organizations suggest expenditures totaling over 3 million
3:53
while IRS form 990 filings since incorporation report less than $50,000
3:59
in total financial activity. These figures may have reasonable explanations, but they also raise
4:06
questions that may be worth clarification to avoid public misrepresentation.
4:11
For these reasons, I respectfully urge Mr. Mcnace to recuse himself from any discussion or vote on the matter. I also
4:18
encourage the board to thoroughly review the facility use agreement and the associated relationships in light of
4:26
these financial discrepancies. Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to provide further information if
4:33
requested. Will Rubble? Thank you, Miss Press.
4:43
Hello, Denise Perez. I'm a resident of Grimes. You all know who I am. Um, just
4:50
saw you some at the governor's days. Um, I'm call u here to speak about the
4:56
contract for New Hope. Um, just because we do have we're in budget
5:02
reconsideration. We know money is a real big issue right now. I in looking at the
5:08
contract itself, it was kind of vague and it doesn't really say what we are um
5:14
charging what our fees are being considered for specific items um with regard to um the contract and
5:24
I'm just asking to table the item until there is more information and further
5:30
clarification with regard to the costs. Um, you know, I looked at the contract.
5:36
I calculated 52 Sundays at 7 and a half hours per Sunday because it's from 6:30
5:42
a.m. to 1:00 p.m. So, some folks might do 53. I'm I just went with a year 52
5:48
weeks in the year. That's 390 billable hours. The contract is for $60,000.
5:57
That means that it's $154 an hour that they're paying. that may cover the
6:03
auditorium and a high school classroom. However, the contract does show they
6:10
want to use the Mustang room, the uh coral rooms, uh the auditorium.
6:16
So, there really needs to be some clarification on what's actually being paid for.
6:21
Excuse me. Especially again, we're in budget reconsideration. We need to be
6:27
specific. We picked those fees. the school board has agreed to those fees for a specific reason. Is it the cost of
6:35
the electricity, the water that's being used, the toilet paper that has to be replaced, and the hand towels?
6:41
Those are the things that I'm concerned in an effort to do something possibly
6:47
positive for the community. I don't know. I'm scared that the school
6:52
district itself is going to be paying for it. So, if it's possible to table
6:57
and um give and honestly, I hate legal ease. I
7:04
hate reading contracts. I don't know anything about what's in there, but I think it's important when we're doing contracts like this that we're including
7:12
a fee schedule in the contract. This is what we're agreeing to. maybe have a clause that says if it
7:19
varies from X to Z, you know, we're we'll account for 10% or 5% or something
7:25
along those lines. Also, there's 9051R
7:31
and that does have audience restrictions on the auditorium. It has that
7:36
supervisors are required for so many people that are in the auditorium. I'm assuming this is for a safety
7:43
um you know review making sure that we have enough people here that are
7:48
covering the interests of the school district and there's also
7:56
again with that 90151R which seems to be like all the safety things. It appears that there's wording
8:04
in the contract with New Hope Church that is kind of trying to surpass or
8:09
curtail or work around. As a citizen, as a taxpayer who, you know, is also
8:17
responsible for where the money that's a school district goes to, I'm concerned that that puts us in a heavy liability.
8:25
So if we can just follow what we have in our you know policies and procedures what's required and provide a fee
8:33
schedule that matches the fee schedule that we have on excuse me on the website
8:39
because again that's public information. It's out there. I calculated if you're doing the auditorium and five of the
8:47
high school classrooms because some other rooms are more expensive. It's 2.75 an hour. That's 125 per the
8:54
auditorium and 30 bucks per classroom. $275 an hour means we should be
9:00
gettingundred $17,250 for that contract. So we have to justify
9:08
that difference.
9:14
Yep. That's all I had. Sorry I had to like run everything really last minute.
9:19
So thank you. Thank you.
9:26
Uh moving along to item four. Um approval of agenda. Looking for a motion.
9:32

10:33
I. Post. Same sign. Motion carries. Moving along to item eight. We do not
10:38
have any written reports or building level reports this evening. Uh so we'll move along to item C. Uh Piper Sandler
10:45
and company presentation. Thanks for coming, Tim.
10:55
The button green. Okay. So, I put in front of you presentation
11:01
and so um I don't want to call them ground rules, but let's walk through what I've done and what I haven't done.
11:07
And so, um uh what I've done is tried to answer a question. How much money is
11:15
available What I've not done is tried to coordinate with the administration or
11:22
design team about any aspect of the projects um timing otherwise. So just
11:30
wanted to focus on helping you understand what kind of resources are available to you and then the next step
11:38
in the process is to do all of that coordination. Is that okay for
11:43
everybody? So there were three scenarios and um there can be infinitely others. I mean I
11:49
just I'm just trying to come up with some from my experience and working on things like this. And so the the the
11:57
easiest one is the first one option one. Um and it answers the question if we
12:05
voted this fall and we sold all of of the bonds next year how much could we
12:11
vote? All right. And so the let's go over the assumptions. Uh obviously one assumption
12:18
I don't know where interest rates will be next year this fall. Uh we chose to
12:23
use the current market rate and then we added a quarter of a percent to kind of give a little bit of cushion. Um the
12:30
second assumption critical assumption is um where will property values be in
12:36
January? Keep in mind you've already approved the budget for FY26. there's nothing we can do that will change the
12:43
budget. So we're talking about FY27 at this point. So that's a new property
12:49
value we'll get here in January um from Dallas and Poke counties. U so the
12:54
assumption is that that the value would go up and an an amount equal to the uh
13:00
10-year average. So uh 10ear average has actually been around 9 and a half%. So
13:06
we assume that it would go up. Doing okay. Okay. So, the um reading from from
13:13
kind of left to right, there's there's a row there um that says column and it has a bunch of numbers one and then on the
13:20
far right it has the number 30. If you see that that I'll occasionally refer to
13:25
the column numbers. Um first off, we're solving for tax rate
13:30
which is shown in column 30. Your uh the max levy rate four $45.
13:37
So as we talk about bond capacity, we are always mindful of that last column
13:43
on the right. Your existing bonds are shown under the first column. You've been, as you know,
13:50
prepaying bonds. Um, uh, getting those paid off quickly has helped reduce the
13:57
interest cost, but it's also created this capacity that we're now talking about. And then the the kind of shaded
14:05
uh peachish column is the new bond schedule if you were to vote. 66 a.5
14:13
million roughly. The rest of it's the math around solving
14:18
for the interest cost on the new bond, coming up with total payments, and then
14:25
coming up with the the levy rate on the far right. Doing okay.
14:31
So, one election, one ballot question,
14:36
we're going to sell all the bonds in 2026. What can we do?
14:42
66.5 million. Maybe you say, you know what, let's round it up or let's round it down. You've got you've got some
14:48
room, wiggle room to do things like that. Now, here's the problem. So, this answers the first question. And when
14:54
Michelle first asked that, I sent her this or some derivative of this.
14:59
The problem now we wander into uh IRS rules. These are tax exempt bonds and so
15:06
we the IRS prescribes a variety of rules that you have to follow. And um one of
15:12
the rules is that you have to spend the money spend the money within two years of when you sell the bots. Cash out the
15:19
door. Not committed to spend but cash out the door. Um it's Iowa. We have winter.
15:28
um you'd vote in November. Presumably, you'd start doing kind of your design type work. Maybe you wouldn't see
15:35
construction bidding until summer or fall of 2026. And you know, that's
15:42
moving right along to get all that money spent in two years. And so, um that
15:47
leads to the second scenario. So on the second scenario, I tried to put a little
15:53
bit more thought into how would we follow the IRS rules.
15:58
Now, um the IRS rules do allow you to sell up to $15 million of bonds in a
16:07
calendar year and instead of having a two-year exception, you have a three-year exception. So that so 2026
16:16
plus three years, we'd have to have spent the money by 29. That's far more in the reasonable range.
16:23
Um, so I added a bond sale. So there's a 26
16:29
bond sale for 15 million designed specifically to take advantage of that IRS rule. And then the balance of the
16:36
bonds in the following year. Now one more luxury is that we added one
16:43
more year property value growth. So instead of one year of 9 and a half% value growth, we now have two years 9
16:50
and a half% property value growth. So instead of being 66 million and some
16:57
change of capacity, we're now up to just over 80 million. 82 and a half million.
17:04
Let me pause. Does that make sense to everybody? Am I losing anyone?
17:11
Okay. And yeah, if you look in column 30, you might say, "Hey, Tim, there's a few of
17:17
those numbers are over 405." You're right. In the third, fourth, fifth decimal place. When we get to actually
17:22
selling the bonds, obviously that will become a limiting factor, and we'll move 5,000 round from here to there to to
17:29
solve for that. Um, so that got me thinking, you know, if
17:35
we're going to do uh well, let me pause there and skip that. some of your neighbors and peers
17:43
around the state have been voting kind of more multi-year
17:49
plans, something that they're going to implement over five or 10 year window of
17:54
time. And so the third scenario then is kind of my attempt to start to show all
18:00
right, what would capacity look like if you're doing something where maybe phase
18:05
one starts in 26 and takes two years and phase two starts in
18:11
27 and takes two years and phase three starts in 28 and whatever. Um, and so
18:19
that that set of facts then introduces an additional year of property value
18:24
growth. So now we're up to getting three years of property value growth on option
18:30
three, three bond sales, um, three 20year payoffs tied to each of
18:37
the bond sales. And now we're up to almost 100 million. So I just gave you
18:44
three different answers to the question, what's our bond capacity? And they range in by $35.5 million, right? I So I
18:53
totally get it that that's stressful and confusing for folks. I consider this if if you like to play
19:00
math, this is a circular. what I just told you probably none of
19:06
these make sense to your design team and your design team is going to sit
19:12
down probably perhaps already has I don't know and say all right here's how we want to stagger projects here's what
19:19
we want to do and stagger them with your input of course and you're going to come back to me and say here's roughly when
19:26
we need money and then I'll redo these numbers again and I'll come back to you and say all right here's when the here's
19:32
what you've got for capacity can't quite get what your design team wants, but we could do this and we get
19:37
close. And there's this back and forth that needs to happen. And we've done none of that exercise yet. So, um, and I
19:46
realize time is very much of the essence if you're going to vote uh this fall. So, we've got a fair bit of work to try
19:53
and it's doable, don't get me wrong, but there's work to be done between now and
19:58
when you approve things in August or September. So, Can I answer any questions or comments?
20:06
Last legislative session, there was some discussion about changing the bonding rules
20:12
for public institutions. Um, in the two or the three-year
20:17
scenario and say next legislative cycle they uh make the proposed change or
20:24
something close to it. If we had already voted on and passed say the two or the
20:30
three-year scenario, is that decision made and can we still raise those bond
20:37
funds uh in those years as delineated or do we have to come back and comply with the new legislation?
20:45
Great question and the answer is perhaps either. Uh it could be in our
20:50
discussions with legislators, we tried to help them understand how they would be negatively facting affecting projects
20:57
that already been voter approved um including some of your neighbors and
21:03
trying to help them understand how we're not sure that's was the intended approach. We left those discussions with
21:10
a sense that they all agreed that wasn't what they were trying to do. Uh, and so we have a uh we have a belief that were
21:18
they to do something next legislative session, were you to have voted in November and passed, they would carve up
21:25
some sort of grandfather type process to protect you. And there's like 50 of you who are going to be in the same boat.
21:33
Not all 50 will pass. That being said, legislature is higher
21:39
in the pecking order and they get to choose the rules by which you play and
21:46
they could certainly say nope. Uh you can't do that.
21:53
Thanks for that. One other question. In the three-year plan, the bonds raised in 2028, would those have to be then spent
22:00
by the end of 2030? Yes. Okay. Now, keep in mind, I'm just making up
22:08
numbers with with dates that have nothing to do with your design. We The next task here is to lay your design
22:14
together. Yeah, I appreciate that.
22:19
What other questions for Tim? Okay,
22:24
Tim, my question maybe for the group potentially is if we decide on a two or
22:30
threeear option, we can still go in November, put one bond language together
22:35
for a multi-year. We wouldn't have to get three years worth of approval. We could do all of that in one setting. Is
22:41
that correct? Correct. Y great. If I can offer one caution about the three-year or anything that looks like
22:48
that, that caution would be we've done this a number of times across the state. I've
22:54
got had the luxury of getting to watch how the those projects work and
23:01
um actually I'm going to end up with two cautions. One caution. Quite often my experience is the public
23:08
forgets that you told them it will take five or six or eight years to implement
23:13
the project once the election has happened. They will be here asking you when is my
23:22
going to be completed and you're going to be pressured and
23:27
scrambling to try and answer that question in the most favorable light. And sometimes that gets to be difficult
23:34
just because our lack of memory. Not criticizing any of you. I don't mean it
23:40
that way. The uh but I I just seen this where people forget, you know, we said
23:45
we'll build the auditorium last and the auditorium folks are here saying when am I getting my auditorium? And I know
23:51
you've got an auditorium. So that's why I'm picking on that one. So the other caution that I would have is a is more
23:58
of a cash Ryan. Back to the question you started with. If the legislature were to
24:04
change the rules after you vote, I'd sure like to have you not have led a
24:10
construction contract to spend money you now don't have to spend.
24:16
Does that make sense? Yep. We're going to have to think some and incorporate your legal team into thinking through
24:24
how do we design, let bond contracts that we know when we
24:31
let the contract, we have the cash to pay for it. Um, we're fortunate to not have had that
24:39
problem on any of the prior elections, but this legislative session, I was a little nervous that that might come up
24:45
and we might have, you know, contracts that we couldn't perform on, which is a
24:50
bad look for for all of us in in the world. Obviously, it' be a stress for for you all. Yeah. The last bond, didn't
24:58
we sell it over a three-year period, or was it two? I think it was two two sales. two sales.
25:04
Okay. We've never done a three.
25:11
Oh, there was a little tail. Yeah. So, we did do three. Okay.
25:22
I don't think we did three when we did the high school.
25:37
Any other questions? Appreciate you, Tim. Thanks for coming
25:42
in. It's always look forward to helping you out. Thanks, Tim. Thanks.
25:49
Stay for Michelle's presentation. All right. Next, we've got Michelle and
25:54
Sean to talk to us about uh equipment breakdown insurance. a strategic investment for DCG.
26:06
Sean, do you Sean, do you want to come up or Okay.
26:13
First of all, I'd like to recognize and thank Sean for wearing a nice DCG shirt tonight.
26:21
I got them, man. I got them. So, I have been talking this year about the possibility of equipment breakdown.
26:29
Um, I'd just like to walk through what that would look like and what our proposal from Remy uh appears to be. Uh,
26:36
a vendor can come into the district and repair equipment or do preventive
26:42
maintenance work to prevent protect against future breakdowns in the HVAC area and be fully reimbursed through
26:50
this insurance program. Also in this program, our staff can act
26:55
as a service vendor uh in which case the school is reimbured for the actual
27:00
salary and benefits uh labor cost at a specified quoted amount per hour. And
27:07
for us that is $70 per hour for our staff. And then if something is unable to be
27:14
repaired under the cost of this insurance, um it would be more expensive to repair, then there's a buyout
27:22
provision included with it. Um and in that buyout provision, age uh actual
27:29
cash value is applied to that piece of equipment. Um it allows us uh most importantly at
27:38
this point in time for us to shift costs from either the general fund or the Pebble fund into the management fund
27:45
which pays for the premium for this insurance policy. and it reimburses the school for uh the
27:53
cost of repairing things that we're doing anyway internally right now and
27:59
things that we are and possibly are not having time to do right now for preventive maintenance. Um so uh it
28:08
includes all parts, all the mailing costs. It even includes $15 to transport
28:14
a part across the district if um the claims are filed for all of those things. uh PO numbers are assigned from
28:21
Remy. They have an online program that we would utilize. They can contact the vendors directly and build uh directly
28:29
to Remy taking us entirely out of the process saving us time in accounting as
28:34
well. Um, I think the one of the most beneficial things for this Remy
28:42
equipment breakdown product is that they have what they call a transparency portal where you can log in in real time
28:49
and see where a claim is at any point in time, exactly what costs are, all the data associated with it, drill down to
28:56
look at invoices, etc. And so it it does provide the most information uh for our
29:03
staff. Um there are two components uh with this policy. One is called the wall-to-wall
29:10
equipment and that is um similar to what the district had many many years ago and
29:15
equipment breakdown. So that's the copier breakdown. That's um the time
29:21
clock on the wall or the badge reader on the wall outside any of those items that
29:26
break down uh the boiler in the kitchen etc. We call we get a claim number. Uh
29:33
they contact a vendor. we contact a vendor and it happens through Remy that
29:38
that repair is paid. Um in addition to that for the first time we have quoted
29:44
the HVAC environmental control option um which is the bigger piece of this but
29:50
probably where we will get the most bang for our buck in this. Um, and specifically we've been working very
29:56
closely with Baker Controls who came in and did an assessment of our entire
30:02
district to take a look at where we are, where our needs are, and priced us accordingly with that.
30:09
This slide is just a view of how a standard claims process works. um the
30:15
claim documentation, that work order, the field service report, any in-house reimbursement request if we're having
30:22
our own people do the work is sent into claims at remy.com. It's then uploaded
30:28
into that portal. Um it it is then reviewed by Remy staff and they
30:34
determine the payment and process that claim. It's automatically pulled into
30:40
Remy online from either that email or an online call. Um, so it's visible to us
30:46
in real time, so we can track how many claims we have out there, how many vendors are paid or unpaid, etc.
30:54
Uh, this is how it looks when it's in-house reimbursement. Uh, obviously, uh, we call and make a
31:03
claim. Our in-house people are doing those repairs. And so, I want you to think about repairs that we're doing every day. Maybe it's Sean or his staff
31:10
on a roof doing an HVAC repair. Maybe it's technology for a staff computer or
31:15
a student computer. Um those are things that are already happening and this
31:21
process allows us to save money in the general fund by getting reimbursement for those costs that we're already um
31:29
spending. We do have to turn those in timely and we've worked on some internal processes here and what that will look
31:35
like for those claims. Um this is what it looks like for potential buyout. some
31:40
of our equipment may be older and the cost of repairing it is going to be more than what it's actually worth. Then uh
31:48
you submit uh that work order within 90 days through the same Remy claims portal
31:55
and that assessment is done and determined uh the actual cash value um
32:01
to determine what if we get a payout. Now remember right now if a piece of
32:06
equipment is too expensive to repair there's there's no payout. we just buy another one and fix it that way. So,
32:15
uh I know this is unreadable. This is possibly more readable on your laptop,
32:20
but this is what the portal looks like and all the information that'll be available to Shan and his staff as we
32:28
process claims, look at claims. Uh, a technology department as well can drill
32:33
down to just their area and see how many claims they have out, how many of those internal claim processing uh for the
32:41
technology department, they have determined that they are all going to file uh claims. So that entire staff of
32:48
four will have the ability to log in. I think in the operations department, we're going to drill that down to three
32:54
individuals that'll have access in there and be able to do that. So we're working
32:59
on what those internal processes look like here. The other great thing about the Remy Remy online transparency portal
33:08
is that we finally get some data um that will help us with our asset. um
33:16
essentials asset essentials program. Dang, that was so close. Our asset essentials program where we have some
33:22
data there. This will provide an extra layer of data for what we're repairing internally or what we went to vendors
33:29
for. Those two are going to tie together because in asset essentials, we're actually going to have drop- down codes
33:35
that are specific to the insurance claims that we make. Anything else I want to say there, Sean?
33:43
This is the big slide. Insurance is about risk. And so when we determine
33:49
risk, uh they're going to set a premium accordingly uh for hopefully to break as close to
33:56
even for us or to make a little bit of money on the insurance company side. For the wallto-wall piece, you'll notice
34:01
there it's just over $400,000 uh for all of that equipment for uh
34:07
wallto-wall uh reimbursement. Uh and then moving into HVAC and preventative
34:14
maintenance, which is a a another big portion of this. Uh we're looking at 1.3
34:21
1.7. I can't see it from here. It's 1.7. Thank you. Uh for that portion,
34:28
do you want to talk kind of about all the different things that are covered in that, Sean? I can. Um so what's covered
34:36
under is not just Hback Hback equipment
34:42
um is actually a separate deal preventative maintenance only on HVAC equipment. We asked the question because
34:50
sorry we were wondering about it covers our lawnmowers, it covers our gators, it
34:55
covers if they break down, we take them to Van Wall, they pay we just do it the
35:00
same way. It covers kitchen equipment. Anything that's wall to wall in the building that is not part of the
35:06
structure, we can actually claim on this insurance. Um the HVAC side, we have we've got a
35:16
lot of equipment in the district. Uh we have 23 water heaters, 11 boilers, 347
35:23
heat pumps, rooftop units 21, ERVs 28, the the list goes on and on to 806
35:32
pieces of HVAC equipment that is all in here. Everything is in here and it shows
35:40
the visits per year preventative maintenance. Um, Baker Group is the
35:46
authorized contractor for that. So, what will be nice is if we do have a
35:51
mechanical breakdown during the day, we already have one of their guys on site, he can quit doing that preventative and
35:58
go be reactive. Anything else?
36:05
Um, this is the fine print for coverage highlights. Um, you can see the $70 per
36:12
hour for in-house and that flat rate for transportation with a cap of 5,229
36:18
in there. Anytime I'm going to have a loss larger than uh expected to be larger than 7,500, we do have a
36:25
notification process where we have to tell them um
36:31
the it's a three-year proposal. So the interesting part about this is it's
36:36
structured so that if we don't make 80% of the premium back
36:45
in repairs for the specific year I thought I put this in maybe it's back here. There it is. Uh the loss ratio
36:51
less than 80% there's no pre no premium increase for the next year. So they have
36:57
given us a guarantee if it is 80 to 100% we'll have a price increase between five
37:04
and 15% of what the premium would be and anything greater than that would be an increase of greater to 15%. So you can
37:11
kind of see where their margin is for what we're looking at. Um excluded
37:16
coverage uh is listed there. They're not going to cover any software any licensing things etc. there. Um, some
37:24
restrictions there on some of the HVAC controls. Um, I have 4,300
37:31
computers in the district. That's that's a lot of computers to be covered in this
37:38
as well. Uh, correct and maintenance repairs
37:43
expenses are capped at $450,000. Um, most of those are already
37:50
identified. Sean has been spending a great deal of time going through all of the mezzanine areas of the district with
37:57
the Baker people uh for weeks on end here in order to get us a good quote for
38:03
this. And that must be my last slide because I
38:08
can't get it to go. Um it is our recommendation to move forward with
38:14
this. We did take one position that was in Shaun's area and determine if this
38:19
goes into effect, we're not going to fill that general fund position. It was an HVAC position. Um, so we do we have
38:28
already realized some general fund savings before even stepping in. If we
38:35
don't move forward with this, of course, that will be that will still be a need that we have to fill in the district.
38:41
Um that was a position that was um currently a ground no what was Randy an
38:49
electrician position and it has not been filled since um that employee
38:57
uh left us. What questions do you have about Remy
39:03
and about spending out a management fund? As you know we did levy uh in advance for this
39:11
So I assume there's an accounts receivable then from Remy as we incur
39:17
either self-performed activities or there's reimbursement for
39:23
third party service as that revenue comes back into the district where does it go does it go to
39:29
general fund or does it go back into management? So, uh, any of the
39:35
reimbursement for actual expenditures would go back into the general fund. So, those salary and benefits would go back
39:41
into the general fund. Or if I, if the claims process gets mixed up and we pay
39:47
a vendor instead of Remy paying the vendor directly, that's how that works. Okay. So, so Remy is the vast majority
39:53
of these Rey's paying the vendor directly. Correct. Got it. Okay. So, there isn't an generally speaking an
40:01
inflow of cash. We make a premium payment, we submit. Well, I suppose
40:07
there would be an inflow of cash relative to the self-perform piece of it. Correct. The outsource piece of it
40:12
would go directly to Baker Group. If the claims are running smoothly, Remy does all of it and just reimbures me for any
40:19
in-house claims that I make or uh any actual cash value they give me for a
40:25
broken down piece of equipment wherein therefore I would replace out of a different expenditure code. So then the
40:30
s then that was the self-perform piece runs as an offset to the salary and benefits of that stuff. And Sean and
40:36
Travis and I have talked um about tracking this very specifically not only through the Remy portal but through
40:43
specific accounting codes and through specific codes that we're going to set up in their asset essentials program uh
40:50
so that we can pull reports and track things that way. Great.
40:58
I'm trying to process and you'll have to forgive me. Um,
41:04
in the past when we've had equipment that's met its usage or um, life
41:10
expectancy, we've gone on gov deals and we've sold those products. But this in
41:17
essence would say that then if those products are no longer of value, instead
41:23
they would reimburse us for the cost of those things. How does Can you talk a little bit about that? I'm just not. So,
41:29
uh, let's pretend it's a copier and that copier is 15 years old and the parts to
41:35
replace it are more than the value of the copier than the value of the copier itself. They would give us an actual
41:41
cash value settlement um, whatever that might be on a 15-year-old copier. Let's
41:46
say it's $100. Then Remy would have the option of taking it if they so wish. Of course, they're never going to come and
41:53
get that copier. And so we would follow the same process to dispose of okay
41:58
district items as we would follow that disposal policy. Okay. On that same on the copers is there like like those
42:05
pruners we just bought those printers last or approved the approval the purchase of those printers last board meeting. Do did we buy a service
42:12
contract for those printers as well? So is like is there overlapping coverage on these? So we've been very cognizant in
42:18
uh entering into any service contracts for this year knowing that this was on the horizon. So, for example, as we bid
42:24
copers this year, we bought the equipment outright without service contracts included.
42:30
And then one other question I had, and I'm probably not reading this right, but it was it's basically 1.4 million more
42:37
to get the HVAC coverage, but they only cover up to 450,000
42:43
annually. just like because 500 of that is preventative maintenance which breaks
42:50
down in all these pieces of equipment and a schedule.
42:55
Okay. And that's different than the Baker because we have the service contract through Baker Group, right? That which is per preventative
43:00
maintenance already, right? Correct. And that one would stop right away. I've already talked to Baker. That would
43:06
stop. Yes. We would just pay for their one visit they did this spring. would be null and void and then they take over
43:12
with Remy. So we pay 1.4 million. They cover 450 of
43:18
it but 500 is preventive maintenance. So there's another 400,000 in there that just goes
43:25
to them. Am I missing that? Am I not reading that right? It goes to the wall to wall. Wall to wall. So that's all
43:30
your computers. That's your No, that's No, that the 400 is wall to wall. 1.8 million minus 400,000 is 1.4 million.
43:39
into the company. I could be wrong. 1.7 total. 1.7 total. Okay. So, 400. So,
43:45
400's already in there for you to look at. So, okay. In the event that we would ever get to
43:51
100% premium, insurance companies don't work that way. Yeah. They're always
43:56
going. That's why they're the tallest buildings in every city. Yeah. I just don't want to make them any taller than
44:01
they have to be. That's all I'm looking at. So we are purchasing an insurance making a risk bet obviously and they're
44:09
going to structure that as best they can to their advantage. Our benefit of course is that we've got some cost shift
44:17
and that we've also got uh some recoup recoupment into the general fund and
44:24
that's why districts look at this option. estimates we think what that might be.
44:30
Is there any like projection on what we might recoup? Did you say that already? Maybe you already did. I kind of lost
44:35
it, but I missed that question. I'm sorry. Do we know what we have any projection on what that what we might
44:40
recoup based on past? I think I think Sean has been working hard with a
44:46
laundry list. Um we can recoup.
44:51
They they like they said they also cover heat pump change outs. So if it is
44:57
beyond life expectancy, they will pay for the material and labor to put a heat
45:02
pump in. We have we have some of those sitting at the shop right now that
45:08
that are at end of life that we could recoup that money at the end.
45:14
What is one of those to replace a heat pump? Yeah. uh depending on the tonnage
45:21
or anything configuration I would say average for a contractor do one of them is 23,000
45:28
okay
45:35
other questions for Sean so is the only downside if we look at like the claims that we make if we had a crazy year
45:41
where we're making a bunch and we have the fee schedule go up I mean that's really the only negative we think moving around the dollars the preventative
45:47
maintenance piece we're going a net positive with a plus. The only thing would be if we had some sort of crazy
45:53
year where we can't obviously you can't predict what's going to happen. That would be the only kind of intangible
45:58
that we can't predict that would be a negative why you would do this. But the positives it sounds like overweigh that
46:04
when I'm married. And I I think your team here in district has identified
46:10
uh where there are caps we will be hitting cap where you know we have a
46:16
listing of plans in order to get this done and get it done effectively.
46:22
From past experience, I can tell you the only thing that makes these type of programs fail is if you don't have a
46:30
welloiled machine for the claims process in district. And we've worked very hard to kind of analyze that and operations
46:37
is setting plans in place as of this week to meet with Remy and get up and
46:42
moving. Awesome. Is there any sort of overlap with our current um like facilities liability um
46:51
insurance and remy when it comes to weather
46:57
meaning that we have rooftop units we have um I mean I guess that that would
47:03
be the primary thing that I'm thinking here. So, with regard to property casualty, for example, if the storm
47:09
tonight tears a ERV off the top of the roof or
47:15
the temperature I I used a big I used a big word there. Okay.
47:22
If something comes off the roof, I'm going to make a claim on property casualty insurance and not mess with
47:29
Remy at all because that's what the coverage is. will pay the deductible for that and and move forward there. Okay.
47:36
So, they they really don't cross. They don't overlap.
47:42
Okay. We just have a lot of crazy weather lately and it seems to be getting more crazy. Uh yeah, two dos in
47:48
my lifetime when I didn't know the word do before. Yeah. Couple polar vortexes,
47:54
etc. What other questions?
48:01
Um I'm just curious other neighboring school districts that participate in this program. Do you can you Yes. Um we
48:09
reviewed testimonials from several different school districts and I'm sorry I don't have that list in front of me
48:16
right now. West Central Valley Sadel and there's another one in the metro. West
48:21
De Moine. Yeah. West De Mo. They're all on the Remy program. As we looked there there are two products out there. We
48:27
looked at the two products. The appeal of this one very specifically is the
48:32
transparency portal and the partnership with Baker and the preventative
48:38
maintenance piece. Um, that's why we think this one is a better product and a better fit for our district. Thank you.
48:50
How much was that bigger contract that will go away? I can't remember what we approved. I want to say it was around
48:55
63,000 annually. Annually. Okay.
49:05
Anything else? Thank you very much. Thanks, Sean.
49:13
Dr. Krenza. All right. Uh good evening. We've got just three things. Uh two of
49:18
them will go pretty quickly and one I'm going take a little bit longer to explain. Uh the first up is state reporting. Just want to bring you up to
49:24
speed with where we're at with those endofear state reports. Um we've, as you can see, we've met all of our deadlines.
49:30
Um CTE, we've uh gone and looked at our student rosters and finished up just
49:35
some details within CTE. Our spring beds is the only one that really isn't fully submitted yet because the state's
49:41
experiencing an issue with their website, but that um information is all in there. our K6 um uh should be sorry
49:49
K8 default assessment report that's the other one I'm working um we won't be
49:54
able to submit it completely even though I said it really is done but with the change over in principles we are stuck
50:01
with one school not being able the principal can't get in yet and the other principal is logged out so no problem
50:06
they'll reopen that in August um spring SRRI is complete as well and u feel like
50:12
we've got assessment accountability that just goes in and make sure that we're um being accountable for scores of students
50:19
that are DCG students and we did have some corrections to make within the civil rights data collection. Um when
50:25
they audited our data, there was just some in discrepancies, not on anybody's fault, but we went in and cleaned up
50:30
that data. So, and some of them weren't an error to begin with. So, questions about state reporting, it's riveting
50:36
stuff. Okay. Uh school improvement process updates. This is the one I want to talk to you about a little bit more
50:42
in depth. You have two attachments in your board report there. The first is our um district and building school
50:49
improvement plans. It's really just the district tonight. Um kind of our timeline. If you remember last month, we
50:55
presented to you on whether or not we met or how we did with regards to our uh
51:00
building and district uh short rual goals and long range goals. This month,
51:05
we want to present to you our new goals for next year that were decided upon with input from our administrative team.
51:12
And then also I want to share with you kind of the framework or the skeleton for our professional development. So
51:18
what you'll see on the uh page well page one of the building uh our district
51:23
goals you'll just kind of see our philosophy this whole idea of setting goals planning our work um the act of
51:30
actually implementing our strategies assessing and and again as we get towards later in the year and actually
51:36
throughout the year reflecting and adjusting our practices. So, um, we have some good things in place. This was our
51:42
second year of running our school improvement plan, our planning process, and it went very, very smoothly. So, at
51:48
the bottom of page two there, you'll see our four district annual goals. Um, some
51:54
of them have not changed and some of them have. So, if you look at our first goal, our academic goal, we did not have
52:01
any changes to that. As you saw at our last meeting in March or May, we had made some pretty good progress in in
52:07
several of our grades. We still acknowledge that we have work to do, but we believe in line with that five-year
52:13
academic goal of 100% of students being proficient that we still have some work to go. We did talk last time too. Ryan
52:19
asked a great question about growth and I see that goal shifting in years to come as we look at how do we ensure that
52:25
students are actually growing not just at proficiency. Um the second goal is we
52:31
have some new steps. So this is our academic support goal around MTSS um behavior and academics. So 100% of our
52:38
DCG buildings will show growth and implementation in what we call 10 capacities of tier 1 and tier 2. So we
52:46
have a framework that describes best practices. We call it a capacity matrix. Just basically says, hey, at tier one in
52:54
terms of philosophy, tier one and tier two, here are best practices that we hope schools will work to achieve. And
53:01
then how do you show evidence? You rank yourself. Where are you at? Hey, we're at beginning, which would be absolutely
53:06
just fine if somebody was in a beginning stage. Or it may be a building that says, hey, we're at wisdom. We could
53:11
teach somebody else how to do this. We're having such good success. Um, we want them to show uh growth in at least
53:18
the 10 capacities of tier one and two. Each one of those capacities is a little bit different. Um, but that's a good
53:25
measurable way for us to also link some evidence so we can be able to talk with those building principles about the work
53:31
they're doing. Goal three is our climate and culture goal. I want to speak to this one for just a little bit. Uh the conditions for
53:38
learning survey. We shared some of the results from that at our last meeting, but we also shared some what I would
53:43
call are some strengths and some areas of of growth maybe with using that tool. Uh as an administrative team, we agreed
53:50
that we would continue with that one more year, the conditions for learning survey. So that would be basically
53:55
asking our buildings to show improvement in uh five percentage points improvement
54:00
in scoring for one or more of those topic areas on the conditions for learning survey. What will happen this
54:07
coming school year along with this goal is we are going to look as an administrative team at a new climate and
54:13
culture survey. um one that we think we well I should say we believe that there's others out there that may yield
54:19
us some better information than what we currently get from the conditions for learning. It's the CFL is not a bad
54:26
tool. We just think we can find others that give us more actionable data um in regards to how our how our buildings are
54:32
operating from a climate and culture standpoint. And then lastly um our teacher efficacy goal. So by 2026 our
54:40
district will have engaged in learning around the integration of PLC's and the strong framework. So last year our goal
54:46
was to just introduce the seven habit or the seven parts of the strong framework and now we're looking at that
54:52
integration between PLC's and strong um so giving our teachers time to actually
54:58
meet in teams and understand how effective teaching can be shaped at their professional learning communities.
55:03
So for that one it is a new step. questions about the goals that you see for for the year for that last one you
55:11
just talked about. How do we like how do we you know just as engaged in learning? There's no real like
55:18
definition of if we achieve that or not. So just curious on how that's going to
55:24
be looked at. Yeah, that definition um we used that also I believe last year with our goal and we took that as um
55:31
engaged in professional development. So, I mean, we aren't measuring how much do
55:36
I love this because that's probably a little bit difficult for us to measure. We wouldn't we probably don't have the tools to do that as much as um we've
55:44
engaged our coaches. So, we will create the presentation here at the district level. We will give it to our
55:50
instructional coaches and principles who will then be able to give input and feedback. So, they're helping to shape
55:56
that process. The principal and the coach will deliver that. Um, for us, I think the engage part means staying on
56:03
the cadence, so we aren't going to lose touch with it. And I think it was a helpful goal for us last year is that we
56:09
had seven and it can be really easy to kind of fall off and trail off. So I I would say that we would intend the
56:16
engagement to be that they're completed and teachers are actively able to use
56:21
that topic. So what they're learning the first hour is generally like the teaching part, the PD part. The second
56:28
hour is application and so we'll keep track of that somehow of which teachers will
56:34
staff have. Yep. As demonst Yeah. So we'll have uh the evidence of this is our professional development agendas in
56:40
minutes. Um some buildings do take attendance. Okay. At PD um some do not.
56:48
Um I think that varies. We haven't established any sort of expectation for that. But what we have said and we've
56:54
had conversations before where if people if if there was a staff member who was taking absences or leaves on those PDs
57:02
that would be a conversation we would have with that staff member. And do we give any surveys or something
57:10
to the teachers about how they implement these PDs in their classrooms or Yeah.
57:16
Um, you know, we saw some really great presentations here from different building leaders about the feedback loop
57:22
that they have with their staff. Yeah. On the professional development and how they're using those researchbased
57:29
strategies and in the classroom. And I think that that sort of building reporting goes a long way with our
57:36
community. you know, it's a snapshot into what those Wednesday afternoons look like and why we're all making this
57:43
big sacrifice of rearranging, you know, our busy lives. I would love
57:49
to have some sort of more formalized piece on that um or reporting back piece as we're diving into so much of this um
57:58
impressive work. You know, how how how is it meaningful to the teachers in the classroom? what are the successes that
58:05
they're seeing with their students because that's why we're doing all this, right? Yeah. Yeah. I I think uh two
58:12
answers I would give you is number one, I would absolutely love the opportunity. Um I nerd out at this kind of stuff, so
58:17
I think it's important that we give teachers an opportunity. And we've done some things like uh Mrs. Olsen did some
58:23
uh teaching showcases, videos of teachers modeling good instruction with our My View series or with UFly. I think
58:30
some of those could serve as evidence. And I love that word evidence because what do we put forth that shows that the
58:35
work that we're doing is important. Um I would want to bring that back to the team because probably a lot of that is
58:41
collected locally, but we need to get to them before the year starts so that they understand what they could be looking
58:47
for. Maybe using part of their building time to report on that as well as district time. We should be giving you
58:52
updates. And I it just got me thinking of how I might craft some of our rather than just reporting.
58:59
Well, I would still continue to report what we do every Wednesday because that's accountability and that's important, but also maybe taking some
59:05
time to highlight things that worked uh from our learning. Absolutely. I just think when um our buildings have that
59:12
opportunity to kind of cross-pollinate and share those um practices, we see how
59:19
meaningful they are to the collaborative process. Yeah. Yeah. Um, we can and we
59:24
could also do a survey and we did a survey this year of how, you know, how people felt the Wednesday went. Um, I
59:30
think we worry I worry at times about survey fatigue because there's so many surveys versus the evidence piece. Um,
59:36
maybe in framed in that light, we would get some good things to be able to share out.
59:41
Nothing like the lesson from a vetted teacher. Yeah, that's Yeah, I agree. Agree. Okay. Any other questions?
59:50
All right. Uh I want to bring your attention to the second document which is our professional learning goals and calendar. So this just gives you an
59:57
overview of professional development and how we've set that up here as a district, our foundation. This has not
1:00:03
changed. We use this going into this past year. We um the roots of our
1:00:08
professional development sit with the professional development model. As you can see there in the diagram that's idea
1:00:14
of hey we're going to find out where we need our support, what our data looks like. We're going to identify that
1:00:20
content. We're going to learn about the content. We're going to implement it in classrooms and keep checking. And then
1:00:25
going back to summit of evaluation, did it work? And I think that's what NY's getting to there. Um, we did, you can
1:00:32
see our professional development calendar structure is defined there. So, these are the times. So, basically,
1:00:38
every Wednesday falls into one of those five categories with the exception of parent teacher conferences at the
1:00:44
elementary and and middle level. That's that's in there. that's in the schedule but not in its own box. So this is the
1:00:50
skeleton. So you can kind of see uh this has been so helpful for our teams. We've had this developed probably since March
1:00:58
at least the skeleton starting it. Um I want to thank u Mr. Justin for his work
1:01:03
to get the classified staff u PD uh not only he met with our uh kind of a team
1:01:09
of classified staff to actually plan what would meaningful PD look like. You
1:01:14
will see in some of those classified staff topics, you'll see an R or an O before it. R is required, so they will
1:01:21
have to be there for those. O is optional, so they have an opportunity to participate if that content is
1:01:26
meaningful for them. Still honors what we said we wanted to do with that uh group of staff and making sure they're
1:01:32
paid as well. Um and then you can see building uh PD is obviously designed by
1:01:38
the building district that will be um Shaye to your question that will be that engagement piece that PLC's work uh with
1:01:46
strong framework and then our flex days are kind of for those groups that we don't always traditionally get to see
1:01:52
but were probably one of the highlights from last year. Uh so questions about
1:01:57
the PD schedule.
1:02:04
Uh one last thing I would leave you with. So next month I will bring to you then all of this into one nice package.
1:02:11
So you can see we kind of build it as we go with the transition of new principles at both the high school and the middle
1:02:16
school. Um we're still waiting for some of their teams and some of their goal work. So we've got plenty of time but
1:02:22
our other teams are off and running. One suggestion I'll offer up to all of you and and Dr. Bloom and I have mentioned
1:02:28
this is uh if you are interested or would be interested in having a work session around um our results from our
1:02:35
Iowa statewide assessment of student progress is um it might be something for
1:02:40
us to gather together maybe early in the fall and be able to look at our results
1:02:45
and and engage you with some of our building leaders in both strengths and areas for improvement yet as based on
1:02:52
those results. I think. Oh, sorry. There's one more.
1:02:58
Decap. I was talked so long I forgot I had a third item. Decap. Uh I'm really proud of this team. If you'll look
1:03:04
there, um our decap team presented. If you remember, the team is right there. I wrote put those in the notes. Uh and at
1:03:10
that time, we weren't quite sure of our formal score, but we did receive 27 out of 36 points. Um which was great because
1:03:17
our previous year, we scored 16. Now, that's of course over many areas of a rubric. It's probably one point
1:03:23
improvement in about seven areas, but I will tell you that group worked harder than ever. And you're going to start to
1:03:29
see those results in terms of students understanding of co of um career readiness skills, understanding their
1:03:36
four-year plans at the high school. Um, we have I don't want to speak for them, but I think we have even bigger plans
1:03:41
for communicating more generalized communication out to the public, uh, utilizing AJ to help us and also um,
1:03:49
with our new career and technical education program coordinator. Um, he'll be coming on board to the team. So, I'm
1:03:56
I'm excited for the work that is ahead, but we um, we were ahead of the state average. So, working towards being a
1:04:02
good role model for other districts that may be similar to DCG. I can p personally speak to this and
1:04:09
that my eighth grader came home telling me all about colleges and jobs that she wants to do and where she
1:04:15
can do become a chiropractor and her four-year plan. So, yes, they did a fabulous job at Oakview with this this
1:04:20
year. That's cool. That's what we want um for the kids and it takes such a team. Um you know, we may have a
1:04:26
leadership team, but that also acknowledges the classroom teachers that are a part. that will probably be the other area where we can gain the most is
1:04:32
right now we have a pretty limited team when we probably should expand the team into more classroom teachers and
1:04:38
representation. So all it's a journey not a race but I'm glad to hear that that's what we want to hear.
1:04:44
And is there any sort of um lens or um
1:04:49
vision towards working with how this might look for our uh senior plus students um Iowa vocational rehab
1:04:57
services and their kind of pathways for after school. I love that comment. That
1:05:03
is all included in the rubrics. Um, and so while we're not perfect in all of
1:05:08
those areas, those are considerations that we know we aren't there yet, but need to be able to do that. So that will
1:05:15
be coming. Um, I would also say if you um, and not to divulge from that, but
1:05:20
because we that is coming for us, we need to get the team arranged. We need to find the special educators. Our um,
1:05:27
special education IDA differentiated accountability team that worked with transition planning, they will be a key
1:05:33
part of that work. Um, and what's happened is all these groups are kind of in isolation. We're not really tying
1:05:38
them all together, which is kind of our next steps. Um, lastly, also with the state, you know, they have moved down
1:05:45
career education down to fifth and sixth grade as well. And we did purchase Zello, which is our career navigator
1:05:52
software, um, for we now have it K12 starting this next year. So, you'll start to see more instruction happening
1:05:58
at the elementaryaries. Super exciting. Any
1:06:04
questions for Dr. Krenza? Okay, thank you. Thank you very much, Dr. Bloom. Three brief updates for me.
1:06:11
First, we had six building permits this month. Six in Grime, zero at this time in Dallas Center. So, there's our totals
1:06:18
for kind of our fiscal year of 119 at this time. Um,
1:06:24
let's take a peek at the estimated enrollment. So, I wanted to share those numbers with you. So, um, we're kind of
1:06:31
still doing off the math of October 1. Um, last year 3576 was our certified
1:06:37
number, uh, that we kind of keep doing the math against. And as of today, students we know are leaving us again,
1:06:45
graduation to moving to a new school, name your situation. And those that have
1:06:50
already registered, so we have, you know, have a firm registration in hand.
1:06:55
That's 3503. So that of course is starting with a bad sign and that's a negative that would be
1:07:02
down 73 students right now. So again if that comes to fruition that would be
1:07:08
three straight years of negative growth. So just want to keep that we'll keep
1:07:14
doing our thing um to keep promoting from the registration side of things. as I know as we get strategic plan and
1:07:21
facility stuff kind of underway. AJ and I have already had lots of conversations kind of about out about what publicity
1:07:28
next steps can be there when we talk about public education and DCG in particular. So that's you know certainly
1:07:34
going to be in the works to the best of our abilities but from just a straight registration process we are down 73 and
1:07:41
that is as of Friday. Um and then lastly just want to give a quick staffing update. Um so we had Adam Juel was named
1:07:49
the activities um assistant to Madison. Madison hired Adam. Adam's a current high school math teacher. So uh that has
1:07:56
a high school math position. Our new high school uh principal has an
1:08:02
interview scheduled next week for that position. So fingers crossed for for good candidates there. Um sixth grade
1:08:10
position is open with a a resignation from a staff member. So our new middle school, Mr. Mr. Snow will have um some
1:08:17
applicants there. So, he will do uh interviews and they're kind of working behind the scenes now with Mr. Jessman
1:08:23
and then Mr. Blackmore is working with Mr. Donghue as well. Uh Don's kind of playing double duty there to help out.
1:08:29
And then we actually have a high school special ed position open and middle school special ed. And that's probably
1:08:36
of the four the four open positions, those are the two I would be the most
1:08:41
concerned about. Um those special ed positions are tough anyway, let alone
1:08:46
summertime. Um I will share with you that they certainly have viable plan B
1:08:53
options and C options in the works if there is not a person um that is hired
1:08:58
that I don't think will in any way do disservice to kids or staff. But we're going to keep uh promoting that. AJ
1:09:05
keeps pumping that those two positions in particular out as much as he can. So again, we'll we'll have plans if
1:09:12
necessary, but those are the four open positions that our principles and Mr. Jess are working together on. So with
1:09:20
that, those are my quick three. Any questions there?
1:09:25
All right. Thanks, M. Uh looking at the revenue expenditure
1:09:30
summary, we've almost made it to the end of the fiscal year. This is just before the June payroll runs or at 95.8% 8% of
1:09:39
our fiscal year. We are at 88.5% of expenditures as appropriated and
1:09:47
96.19% of revenue. Remember, uh things like
1:09:53
special education tuition, uh some of that open enrollment tuition, none of those revenues come in until the very
1:10:01
last moment or even into July and are acrewed back in. So I fully see us at
1:10:06
100 100% of appropriated revenue for the year. Looking at our public budget
1:10:12
comparison as of the same date, June 18th, 2025, uh this leaves three payrolls to run
1:10:20
with certified teachers in this view. instruction at 82% there, support
1:10:26
services at 76, non-instruction uh at 51, and our debt service area at 37%.
1:10:35
So, all of that looking good.
1:10:42
Any questions for Miss Wearman? All right, we'll move along to old
1:10:48
business. We've got the second reading of uh seven uh let's see 57 800 series
1:10:55
policies. Looking for a motion. Move to approve. Dickinson
1:11:01
second. Baker Curtis. Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I.
1:11:08
I. Oppose. Same sign. Motion carries. Moving along to new business. the first
1:11:14
reading of um uh some let's see one two four five six
1:11:22
700 uh series policies and then one to resend
1:11:28
looking for a motion move to approve mcnese secondberg any discussion
1:11:36
yeah I have um so on the uh it's 505 when it talks about all the graduation
1:11:43
I think qualifications or whatever requirements. Um there's a bunch of stuff in there that just looks like it
1:11:48
talks about if you're after 2022 and then you're after 2023 and like I don't know if we plan on cleaning that up a
1:11:54
little bit. Um and so just something to to look at. I just don't know why we have all that in
1:12:00
there because it's now we're passed. Um and then also the honors diploma. I thought we were getting rid of that but
1:12:06
I didn't know when that was happening. So that is all in there as well. So just something and maybe that's next year
1:12:12
that could be in maybe I don't know what year we were getting rid of that but the honors diploma is also going away
1:12:18
to go back right so just maybe that's something just we put in here that it's gone like we maybe need to just list that it's in here that we're going away
1:12:24
so we talked about the cleanup okay it just reads it's um looking at other
1:12:30
policies from around the area plus IBS those I think were notes I wasn't clear
1:12:35
on if they were meant to stay there done previous to us being here. So, um I mean
1:12:41
if there's if there's agreement that it's clunky and it doesn't read well, we could easily clean that up in another review that wouldn't change the content
1:12:48
of the policy. Just as someone who super loves tidy policy, um there might be
1:12:53
something to leaving it in the event since we're changing what the requirements were. But if we have
1:12:58
graduates that are now I mean 22 and 23 is probably a little bit outside of that. But if we have graduates whose
1:13:05
high school um credits are being questioned for something for application into a program somewhere, but they need
1:13:11
to make sure that that they did actually fulfill the requirements for graduation per an old policy versus what is the new
1:13:18
policy, there might be something to leaving that in there for like a fiveyear or three year or something to
1:13:23
that. Yeah, I'd love your guidance. If we did take I'm sorry, Monica. No, I'm just
1:13:28
saying that would make sense because that's what I was thinking too that we kept it in there for historical. So if someone Yeah, that's being questioned at
1:13:35
a university. It's going to get really long if we keep Well, I mean, not forever, just you know, and the primer
1:13:41
just came out, so we wouldn't I don't think we wanted to make a move to clean that up without some more in order to
1:13:47
get it to this board meeting. So yeah, I I agree. There is an ability in Simly to
1:13:52
go back and look at past copies. The public couldn't do it, but the
1:13:58
behind the scenes. We could pull up a pass if we cleaned it up. I'm not opposed to leaving it. It's just
1:14:03
something I think that creates could it just doesn't read well. It was very I
1:14:08
would read it. Well, wait, that doesn't matter right now. Oh, wait. And so, it just got a little confusing, but it's fine. Great point. So, I think to the
1:14:14
honors diploma piece, I think it can probably come out of policy but stay in
1:14:19
our handbook because we are going to grandfather in those students that are
1:14:25
currently working towards the honors diploma. it would be kind of that I I I forget if it's that this current
1:14:31
freshman year class coming in that's the group that's like nope it doesn't exist
1:14:36
anymore but certainly for those upper classmen that have been working with this in mind I know we want to take care
1:14:42
of them so maybe that the policy piece it comes out but it stays with the asterisk or explanation inside the high
1:14:49
school handbook we're done with that one I have another
1:14:55
one um so 402.03 for abuse of students. We take out the whole level one
1:15:01
investigator. Are we just getting like is that just not happening now? Is that happening by a different agency? Sorry,
1:15:09
this you're you're going to like you're not you're Greg's going to explain the
1:15:14
new challenge, but so um yeah, this is the model policy from IASB. Um, it does
1:15:22
the law and I I can't remember what bill number right off the top of my head that removed the layer. It was in her omnibus
1:15:29
bill. I think it was one of the last ones that she signed. It takes away any level one and level two investigations.
1:15:35
Anytime a claim about abuse of a student is made by whether an employee or a parent or um that then that complaint is
1:15:43
then turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services for investigation. And that's kind of what I thought, but I wanted to make sure that
1:15:49
I was reading that. So all the level one language would be uh struck then from handbooks and all of that. Um that they
1:15:56
would then HHS would then communicate with the school district as to the status of the complaint. Okay. Thank
1:16:03
you. That's all I had on policies. Yeah. Very good. Any other discussion?
1:16:12
All those in favor indicate by saying I. Both same sign. Motion carries.
1:16:19
Item B, uh, set substitute teacher pay for the 2526 school year and substitute
1:16:24
incentive. Looking for a motion. Move to approve Baker Curtis. Second, Dickinson.

1:17:15
All those in favor indicate by saying I. Post same sign. Motion carries. Item E,

1:17:27
Move to approve. Vanderved. Second. Mcnace. Any discussion?
1:17:33
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Post. Same sign. Motion carries. Item
1:17:40
F, the facilities use agreement. Looking for a motion. Move to approve. Malberg.
1:17:46
Second. Viella. Any discussion? Yes. Okay. So, I actually had the same
1:17:53
questions that Denise raised on the cost. Um, it actually is 53 Sundays. Did
1:17:58
the math. Um, it is, she said seven and a half hours. I believe it's six and a half hours. Um and so if you look at
1:18:04
they are a grade what or the three whatever that is the group three. So that actually comes out to um 79,235
1:18:14
if you're doing one classroom, one vocal room and one auditorium. I would say the facility agreement is a little confusing
1:18:21
like she said. Um are they doing two vocal rooms? One it said choir rooms I think. Is that one room, two rooms? Is
1:18:27
it just the Mustang room? So, I do would like to see just some more clarity around that because this costing does
1:18:33
not match what as a board we approved for facility fees. So, a breakdown would
1:18:38
be very helpful um because it does not line up with our current facilities costing. Um because I show $30 for one
1:18:46
classroom, $75 for a vocal room, and $125 for an auditorium, which would be $230,
1:18:53
six and a half hours, 53 weeks. So, that's where I get the 79 235. So, just
1:18:58
something that I mean I don't think it looks great if we're giving a discount per se um when we clearly have and have
1:19:07
approved a facilities cont.
1:19:13
So, let me Yeah, great questions. Great point. I'll tell you how the rough number of 60,000 came to be and if we
1:19:20
want to, you know, we got to go back and tighten anything or bring more stuff, you got it. So, you know, working with
1:19:27
working with Zach over the last handful of months, you know, I'm I'm somewhat under the impression that all of those
1:19:32
areas, so auditorium, two vocal music rooms, and the Mustang Room will not all
1:19:38
be used for six and a half hours every single Sunday. Okay? Like church services at this time, youth stuff is at
1:19:45
this time. So, what I did was I took 6.5 hours and multiplied it by the highest
1:19:50
number, which was the auditorium rate. Assuming you sat in the auditorium the whole time for six and a half hours,
1:19:56
that was the $125 an hour at group three. That is $812 a day using the 52
1:20:04
weeks or so. That was roughly $39,000. As part of the agreement, DCG is not
1:20:11
probably staffed to the point where we can have a custodian in there the whole time. Jake that runs our auditorium the
1:20:16
whole time there. So they're they're being charged $50 per hour on top of the
1:20:22
60,000 for training from Travis and Shawn as well as Jake on using the the
1:20:29
little equipment they need but to run, you know, some lights and sound and then they will have the custodial um
1:20:35
obligations themselves. So they will have certain criteria from Travis and Sean to, you know, take care of all of
1:20:41
our custodial needs and then do their technology. So, I took a typical $35 I
1:20:47
think is is in the fee for custodian at 6.5 hours again times the 52 that was
1:20:54
about $10,920. I actually added the additional personnel number at $30 an hour. That
1:21:00
person again won't be there. They are responsible for it, but that comes to about a little over 9,300. So, that
1:21:06
total to me was $59,280. So, that's where that round number of
1:21:13
60,000 came. If you want me to go back and talk to Zach about the very specific hours that
1:21:20
they will be in each of those places, I understand. I took the six and a half hours at the
1:21:27
highest number which was the 125 again with with the information of I I won't
1:21:33
be in all three spaces for six and a half hours each time. So they got charged the
1:21:40
highest number per hour. They they also got charged with the custodial fee and personnel fee
1:21:46
and those people won't be there. Um that's as much as staffing issue on our end, but they had no qualms about that.
1:21:53
They will also pay the additional $50 like I said for however long the training takes and you know they
1:21:59
understand that we can terminate this at any point if they are not cleaning up to our standards. They are responsible as
1:22:06
you read for like snow removal. Um, so th that's where the numbers Denise had
1:22:12
fair questions, but I that's not just 60,000 because it feels good. That's how
1:22:19
the math came. So, I feel like it would be prudent um to
1:22:26
itemize like Denise's request. Um, if if this agreement does have limitations on
1:22:33
the additional rooms, then I think that is worth noting. Okay. Okay. So, you're not paying for 6 and 1/2 hours for these additional rooms, but you are paying for
1:22:41
3 hours at this rate for these rooms. And I think that that should be outlined
1:22:47
in a contract. If for no other reason than it's very important from a liability standpoint in the event that
1:22:52
someone is in one of those rooms that they did not have contracted hours for, that they are not paying for, but something happens, then that's a
1:22:58
problem. Yeah, that fair. they they in the contract they are responsible for all
1:23:06
four areas or three the two choir rooms, Mustang room and auditorium. So then it comes to be either they are 100%
1:23:13
responsible for the entirety that they are renting those and they will pay for that accordingly or they are not responsible for it during those hours
1:23:19
which they are not paying for. What did our attorney say? I'm sure that
1:23:25
you don't really Yeah. I mean, of course, everything in any contract goes through their attorneys, our
1:23:32
attorneys. So, Michelle and I have been working close with allers on all the drafted language. So, I mean, they have
1:23:37
our they don't have our fee schedule, right? But they certainly
1:23:43
there's as much allers as anything else in this agreement. So, they're aware.
1:23:49
We use, you know, you guys probably know we use our gyms for, you know, lots of
1:23:55
things. um or classrooms are used and paid for different things. Um churches have certainly been a they're very
1:24:01
prevalent in schools, right, where they where they run. We've had it in the past. I think it's been a while at DCG,
1:24:08
but so I don't think that's for me that's not the issue. We're just making sure that we are being fair with how
1:24:15
we're charging. So if any other group came in, would they get the same? Yeah. You know, I for me that's the bigger
1:24:21
issue. I understand the item is that there's there's no doubt the fairness piece is happening. But if that means an
1:24:27
itemized and I'll go back to Zach and Zach it went from 60 to 68. There's
1:24:33
certainly a possibility that I go back to Zach and say it went from 60 to 52, you know? I mean, it could it can go
1:24:38
down just as easy as it can go up. So, well, then it's just being accurate, too. Like, I just, you know, um because
1:24:44
I you would think that they're using more than one room at a time if they're having church and Sunday school at the same time or I you know, I don't know what their their plan is, but Um, yeah,
1:24:52
that was just And then how does the access part work? So, since we won't have an employee or district staff
1:24:58
there, how does that work for them to access? Yeah, so they will get they'll get specific access to like um the
1:25:05
custodial closet that they'll need those things that we can we can either keycard them at certain times or program the
1:25:12
high school to be open at certain times during the you know, it can be open. So, it's all automatic. There's no like keys
1:25:18
that you're handing out or anything like that. The only keys I am would be handing to them would be those specific
1:25:24
rooms that they would have to get into. So those are not carded. Those are key literally keys that they could take in.
1:25:30
Yep. Yep. The building is carded. The actual room is not. Okay. Yeah.
1:25:37
I have another question um pertaining to the holiday clause in the facility usage
1:25:43
in the contract. Um, so it says that there will be an additional fee for holidays which are specifically verboten
1:25:51
in policy. Um, and I'm curious what that fee is.
1:25:58
If they if they did they want to have church on a on a holiday or a Saturday, then we would charge the per hour fee in
1:26:05
addition, you know, it'd be like a normal Sunday fee of 812, whatever I listed to that Saturday. And great
1:26:14
question if I make because I also want to make clear in here because it's in district policy and of course Zach understands this as well. 52 is the
1:26:22
appropriate number as we're doing math 52 weeks. They won't be in there 52 weeks because school still takes top
1:26:27
priority. So they will not be in there for musical weekends. They will not be in there for prom weekends. uh a
1:26:34
pre-arranged um you know sometimes we have the dance team rents
1:26:41
it out or whatever like already on the books so it'll maybe be the majority of Sundays but they are paying for a year
1:26:47
and it won't quite be 52 weeks because school is still going to win and so if
1:26:53
something comes in later let's say we do put this contract through and someone comes and needs that that is a district
1:26:59
event that takes precedence correct okay yep absolutely And can you correct me if I'm wrong on
1:27:05
the fee schedule? That's like a onetime use fee schedule, I'm assuming. So, if I wanted to use it
1:27:10
for one time, right? I would assume that would be the fee schedule. It does not say that it's a onetime fee schedule. Yeah. I mean, it would be if I wanted to
1:27:17
rent out for one weekend, this would be the fee schedule. Yes. But it also could be reoccurring though. It's like our
1:27:23
gyms for youth youth basketball. There's going to be a rolling that's not a one
1:27:29
time. That's a we use it for four days a week for four hours a night. Still pay the same. I just want to say so as as
1:27:36
you're going out to longer and longer contracts, typically you're reduce the fee schedule. If I'm I'm assuming most
1:27:41
people aren't signing year-long contracts to guarantee dollars to the district. So instead of saying I'm going to use it for two weeks, I'm going to
1:27:47
use it for a year. I'm assuming that's also probably taken into consideration based on those numbers. It seems like this is also on the higher end. I think
1:27:53
that would be a very bold assumption given that we've already had board approval for a fee schedule without any
1:27:59
sort of stipulation on a year-long contract. I think that's why this the policy has this right it has it's right
1:28:05
in here. We don't have to cherrypick certain things out of it right here. It's right in the policy. Note the
1:28:10
superintendent andor board may in his discretion approve other uses and set
1:28:15
fees accordingly. We haven't had that discussion yet though. That's what we're
1:28:20
doing right now. So precisely. So I think what setting the fees is what Dr.
1:28:26
Bloom is proposing on the special use. I think it's also
1:28:32
prudent to remember that we set the fee schedule in July. So we're a month ahead of setting a fee schedule for the
1:28:37
upcoming year and when this would come into play. So I think it would be prudent to table this until we have come to a decision on whether or not those
1:28:43
fees adjust up or down based on our needs for the the upcoming year.
1:28:48
Do you know if that's going to do we have any? No, I have not. We don't know if that's changing. That was Yeah,
1:28:54
something else I was going to bring up is that next month. I don't see any reason it is, but I also have not talked
1:28:59
with Madison in advance. I'm not sure if Madison maybe has her feet under her to
1:29:05
need to worry about raising or lowering these feet. I'm sure she'll come to Michelle and I for guidance. And I have
1:29:11
not heard one way or the other that these are too high, too low. So I think
1:29:17
a fair starting point is probably at the same number. Yeah. I think it was contemplated in the
1:29:22
policy that you're going to have instances where you're going to have people come in and whether it's over a long period of
1:29:30
time or there's different situations that are at play. You're going to
1:29:35
admin team and whoever that user are going to work together. You're going to come up with like Dr. Bloom walked us
1:29:42
through the calculation. It's not arbitrary. I think there's a little bit of give and take on this. They can't be
1:29:48
here every Sunday because we've got things that we know that are going to get in the way. There's things that may
1:29:54
come up that'll get in the way. Um we don't have staff.
1:30:01
It's not reasonable for us to have staff or affordable for us to have staff like we would typically have. And so there's
1:30:08
kind of give and take on both sides. So I understand in this particular case why we deviated from
1:30:14
the schedule and kind of more negotiated to a number. So um
1:30:21
personally don't see an issue with it. I think that's why the policy was written the way that
1:30:27
it is because you're going to have situations that are going to just be different. I think this one's just different.
1:30:34
It does help the cost that they are not there. I did not know that they were not going to be there every week. So that
1:30:40
does probably bring that cost down if you're actually looking at it by each item. But I still think it would be and
1:30:46
maybe it's just something where we put in the contract like why like what you said like that wasn't in the contract.
1:30:52
So I guess it was it would have been nice to have that information I guess on how that was how how did the 60,000 even
1:30:57
come about. So maybe that's something we just add into the contract. So it is
1:31:04
written down not just you know in a board meeting that we talked about but well a contract's a binding agreement
1:31:09
and it's there not only to protect us but also to protect the uni users. Right. And so I think what you're asking
1:31:17
is in good faith. Right. Right. And it's not necessarily to say no I don't
1:31:24
approve of this. It's saying I'd like more information and the effort to be I
1:31:30
if I had all of the same questions you all had and had some folks reach out to me and just felt like I didn't have
1:31:36
enough information to be able to respond. Yeah. And maybe this is the right or not time. These questions have
1:31:43
to be asked publicly, especially when we have these. But as I say, please reach
1:31:48
out if you have questions in advance so I can give you that information when
1:31:54
you're getting those questions, too. So, if there's something that you see on a Friday night when you're reading this,
1:32:01
text, email, so I can get you the information promptly in advance.
1:32:13
What other discussion is there?
1:32:18
I would like to see wording in the contract that states what Sundays we already know they will not be using,
1:32:24
right? Musical Sunday, prom Sunday, whatever is already on the calendar to
1:32:29
have those blocked out.
1:32:35
I mean, that is a theme that did come up when we had the I'm thinking it was the last facilities meeting, wasn't it? Um,
1:32:44
and trying to schedule the auditorium and that it's a very highly used space
1:32:51
and then we had the huge discussion about bookings and Yes. I think that's something you put in a contract though.
1:32:57
It would absolutely be something you put in a rental agreement and it's it's in the contract. It's already in the it's
1:33:03
already in the contract. Section four, I think. Yeah. So, well, yeah, but dates
1:33:08
change. So, then you're going to go back, you know, the musical changes. It has changed. So, then you're going to go
1:33:14
back and say, "Sorry, this contract's null and void because that date's wrong." The district has to give one
1:33:19
week. Says you have to give them one week in advance. So that allows the district to use it when they need areas. If we had a set number of if we had a
1:33:26
handful up to and including four weekends that the district will maintain for usage because of these events, then
1:33:33
it's the CIA on the district's end, but it's also something that can help people who are reading through this with an itemized like there are enough people
1:33:40
that were concerned about budgeting here. So, if you have line items where people can go through and figure out how they've arrived at this dollar amount, I
1:33:48
think that's I think we're trading something away if we go that way. We have all the flexibility in the world
1:33:55
under item B to restrict use. Okay. So,
1:34:01
I I don't know why we would want to move to language that could potentially limit
1:34:07
put us in a box the school district's ability to res.
1:34:12
for its own use. Okay. May Can you clarify? What's your budgeting? You had a budgeting concern. I think budgeting
1:34:19
was the wrong word. Okay. The the arriving at the dollar amount, right? The fee schedule and the application
1:34:24
here. Correct. Because I just So if it's not 52 weeks and it's actually 49. Yeah.
1:34:31
Then that would be Yeah. something that would be very lovely to clarify for stakeholders. Yep. Because so this says
1:34:38
Oh, sorry. currently currently right now on most of these Sundays nothing is going on. So this will be a
1:34:46
little little win in the general Oh budget agree it's yeah look I will do
1:34:51
some math with Zach on to the best of their ability on hours in
1:34:57
each place and just kind of see where that lands and share that info and one
1:35:02
way or the other. So this is going in general fund correct? Yeah. Okay. And then it says it's paid quarterly. Does
1:35:09
that first quarter come in before they start? Is there any type of down payment or something or is it just they go a
1:35:16
quarter and then they pay? How does that work for the the pay schedule? Yeah, to my my understanding that they were going
1:35:21
to pay their first quarter prior. So like they were going to get in and start using at the end of September. They're
1:35:28
not actually would not have a service. I understand till maybe a few weeks later.
1:35:34
So like the first payment would be made prior to like this we're having our
1:35:39
participants here. So early early October would be like quarter 1. Okay.
1:35:45
To be paid by the end of September 26. The Yeah. The last quarter would be
1:35:50
paid. Exactly. And the anticipated attendance meets that 50 or fewer threshold for the fee schedule? No, I'm
1:35:58
sure it's going to be more than 50. I I bet it's closer to 100 150. That is
1:36:03
something that policy outlines too that um for populations over 100 there are
1:36:10
other expectations. I believe it's just supervision supervision that we're already letting out. But something worth
1:36:17
noting that especially for use of the auditorium, if they're going to have over 100 people in there, then you would
1:36:22
have to have additional fees. If that's something that we have in policy, if we were going to pay for additional staff
1:36:28
or additional custodians to do that, then in theory, you said that's included. We're not doing that. It's already included. It's included, but
1:36:34
we're not making them correct. Be there, which is we are making them do the custodial work. Okay. Yes. We're
1:36:40
charging them and they're doing the work. Correct.
1:36:49
What other discussion? I'll move us along to vote. All those in
1:36:55
favor indicate by saying I. I. I. Oppose. Same sign. Nay. Nay.
1:37:02
Uh, any abstensions? I. Motion carries.
1:37:11
All right. I'll move salon.
1:37:20
I'm sorry. I have to Megan Nancy.

1:37:37
Okay. Moving us along to item G, equipment breakdown insurance. This was

uh the presentation that uh Michelle and Sean walked us through earlier. Looking
1:37:47
for a motion. Move to approve. Mberg second. Mcnise. Any discussion?
1:37:55
I I just have a comment. I want to thank Michelle and Sean. I I think you know
1:38:01
school finance is complicated and you know there's funds that are limited and
1:38:06
um and when we're an have the ability to find something that we can levy for like
1:38:13
management fund that we don't always have a intended use for all what we can
1:38:19
levy and we can move some dollars out of general fund and move that to management fund. Those folks that are watching that
1:38:25
probably means nothing to them. It means a whole bunch to us and the flow through is it it means that there's more money
1:38:32
available in the general fund to pay teachers, give them raises and educator kids. And so just a big thanks to
1:38:38
Michelle and Sean because I know That's a lot of work to go and put a full year
1:38:44
preventative maintenance schedule together on 800 pieces of mechanical equipment. That doesn't happen overnight. So, uh, we're really
1:38:51
fortunate to have the staff that we have here at this district and and just want to pass along a big thanks to you guys.
1:38:58
