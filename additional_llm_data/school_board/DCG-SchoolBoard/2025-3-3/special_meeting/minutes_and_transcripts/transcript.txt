0:50
carries moving along to new business item a considered Venture land contract for Oak viw ban performance looking for
0:57
a motion move to approve mberg second Dickson any
1:03
discussion all those in favor indicate by saying I I post same sign motion
1:10
carries moving along to Item B not going to ask for a motion right now I think the Board needs some time to uh discuss
1:17
uh potential resolution for an ad hoc committee uh of the board uh this was
1:23
taken up at uh a meeting a week ago today and the determination was we would reconvene in a special meeting to to
1:30
take this up so I don't believe that we uh are ready to take a motion yet um is
1:37
is this Meg a redraft it is an updated draft yes okay so do we want to maybe
1:42
start with uh uh director Dickinson walking us through this is potential
1:47
starting point we can move into discussion uh take up any potential edits and then move on to a motion um
1:54
and then take it into to vote does that sound like an okay path sure okay
2:00
go ahead um So based on our discussion last week um I've updated a lot of the verbiage well all of the verbage to be
2:07
District centered so whereas anything said Dallas Center Elementary it now
2:13
says Dallas Center Grimes Community School District um I did update the
2:18
verbiage regarding the Nea framework for collaboration to relevant components so
2:24
that way we are still um using that as a scaffolding Point um to to encourage our
2:31
committee to use that as a basis for their work um but it is not necessarily
2:37
A a full requirement to use the entirety of that framework um the duties I
2:44
honestly left the same I feel like those are really important and um very clearly
2:52
stated but there's still enough wiggle room within all of their duties um to
2:58
not only work the issues that we are seeing as a district regarding um enrollment across the board
3:06
but also um how we can work collaboratively with the community and other stakeholders
3:13
um and then committee composition was a huge sticking point so I left that as
3:18
vague as possible so that we can all work together to create some verbage around that um it shall be
3:23
representative of the school district community and will'll consider various viewpoints on the issue um per uh board
3:30
policy 208 I did say that a designated board member representative Shall Serve on the committee um I think that having
3:37
that bridge between parents working and someone from the board or Administration
3:43
is a valuable asset and for what it's worth I will happily throw my hat in the ring for that leadership um I removed
3:52
any specific leadership there and said that the committee will elect their own chairperson or appoint their own
3:58
chairperson and that brings us to the the end of the resolution so if you have any questions
4:04
about any of those please speak
4:09
up so how would what's the difference between This and like
4:14
Sak um like the Strategic framework like the Strate strategic plan that we've
4:19
done like all that stuff what would be the difference here between those other two committees this one is very specific
4:25
it has a very specific list of Duties um and it operates outside of of any sort
4:30
of administrative oversight whereas Sak is an administrative
4:36
um uh committee right or the wellness committee or the buildings committee or the facilities committee those are all
4:42
under the administration and they're ongoing an ad hoc committee has very specific goals and once those goals are
4:47
achieved then that dissolves but the goals that are in here would they be disimilar from the
4:54
strategic planning report and all the stuff that Teamworks has done they're more focused at least in so far that's
5:01
that's the goal of them to be more focused around the idea of marketing and
5:06
attracting um teachers and students families to the district so while that
5:12
is part of the Strategic plan committee planning committee um this one is
5:17
focused on on that specific issue um and with a narrower view I do think Brandon
5:25
just seeing where we're going with strategic planning there's going to be some neat like one year two year threee steps I do feel
5:32
this is going to have a more as Meg put it a more specific Focus that is here
5:39
does its job and goes away strategic planning is going to be a touch broader I think they can use some stuff in there
5:44
but I I do I don't think we should put all our eggs in the strategic planning basket like that's going to answer all
5:51
of the questions potentially this group talks about I do think it'll be broader than maybe what this this group will be
5:58
tasked with for what that's worth and haven't we also seen that well we've
6:03
had um outside experts come in and make projections for enrollment and
6:10
projections for things that those have been somewhat a bit off and we have used
6:15
that data to drive some of our strategic planning um when I went to the iasb
6:21
conference one of the school districts that presented was anony um they're a metropolitan school they have a similar
6:29
um they have many factors that I think we would look to as a model for being an
6:36
excellent school district and one of the things that the superintendent and their
6:41
board president specifically presented on was being
6:47
responsive to issues as they come up and how that responsiveness might look
6:53
potentially different in different for different subgroups based on different needs um and it really was the
7:01
discussion point of being proactive and responsive as opposed you know when we do data we talk about dead data all the
7:08
time and how that dead data you know it it's not good it can't drive us it doesn't allow us to address future
7:16
concerns as they're coming down the pipeline and I think one of the things that we talked about in our last meeting
7:21
is for whatever reason those projections we had are inaccurate when it comes to
7:27
in terms of enrollment um um and I have even heard director MCN or um director
7:33
Carpenter state in this same room the need for us to be attracting whether that is dual enrolled
7:41
homeschool students whether that is open enrolled students right and so how do we
7:46
do that and that could be a compos a component of this sort of an ad hoc
7:53
committee correct sorry I it's been kind of a stressful B too much cof I think for me
8:01
that's I mean I'm not this isn't a hill I'm going to die on like obviously um I guess the the from my point of view I
8:08
mean I guess I'd love to hear everyone else and what they think but when I think about the primary focus of the
8:14
student piece of it at least the variables that I think about in the community that would be bringing in the
8:20
students I think are outside the purview of the district the main drivers of those being homes that are available uh
8:28
economic expansion different things like that where so I think a lot of this potentially would be better served at
8:34
the city council level to be honest um but I'm open to hear everybody else I
8:40
mean it's again I'm not willing to if you that people want to form a committee I guess okay but I think really when we
8:47
think about this and how this even started it's enrollment in Dallas Center the thing that drives enrollment really
8:53
has to do with a city function and and I trust that our Administration is interacting with the city to make those
9:00
types of things happen if we all think that there needs to be an outout committee to further that okay um I
9:06
guess I'm open to that but um yeah do you do you know if we've lost
9:13
any students already from enrollment at Dallas Center that have gone to ADM or anything like that because I
9:22
have got an email from someone again I don't know if it's accurate or not but I've heard that there are three already from Dallas Center that have opened
9:28
enrolled to to ADM that I mean we just opened our registration so that that's a if
9:35
that's correct again I I don't have that information that's just from someone just the thing I mean yeah we talk about
9:43
attracting well we already lost three students within a month and so that's a little concerning for kindergarten
9:49
students by the way three kindergarten students our our projected Heritage enrollment is down 45 students as well
9:54
this is a district issue our district is down students um I had a parent Reach Out to me today who spent several it had
10:01
to have been several hours because they did they uh worked on data from dcg and
10:07
15 other districts over the last eight years so clearly we have different versions of fun and hobbies this parent
10:14
and I um and their data came back with 75% of Metro districts seeing K through
10:20
4 enrollment decrease but that is often masked because there is there are more
10:26
numbers and higher grades so on the whole it still looks looks like enrollment is like fish but when you
10:32
break it down in those K through four grades it's very significant across the metro and that's 15 other districts
10:38
right like it's not just us it's also worth noting that Central Iowa birth rates are down 7% since 2015 so if you
10:46
think about that over the course of five like every five years you're going to see a kindergarten decline too this is
10:53
yes it's an Iowa problem it's a town problem but it is also a district problem and I think something that we
10:59
really need to consider too is what what like our version of success as a district looks like and how are we
11:07
serving all of our students from a district perspective yes maybe we don't
11:12
have the homes for everyone at this very moment but that doesn't mean that people aren't driving we heard from them last
11:18
week it doesn't mean that people aren't willing to like stay here or come here we just have to figure out how to meet them and make this an attractive option
11:27
and use what we have already to work this
11:33
issue so we know how the member how this will be formed like for
11:40
members so um in looking at committees that already exist there's a variety of
11:48
ways that committees are formed there are some that are volunteer-based and then they are um those volunteers are
11:55
approved by Administration or the chairperson of that board um we we do have a committee that is handpicked by
12:02
Bloom we have a committee that or we have a few committees what I just
12:07
clearing my throat sorry quieter Nick um he's trying to breathe over
12:13
here um we have committees that are um appointed by like Sak is appointed by
12:21
principles um so there there are a variety of ways to get people on a committee um like I said this particular
12:29
particular parent spent I don't even want to know how much time over we there there are people willing to volunteer
12:35
and um bring a whole host of Specialties to working this issue um some
12:43
Specialties I don't even like remember all of the words to their working titles like they're way cooler than I am um so
12:53
I don't know I left that veg because I knew that was a sticking point last week so since this was going to be a workable
13:00
draft let's talk about it I think the SC
13:06
committee would be a great place for all of this to fit in like we have good representation of in that committee and
13:13
it' be a great for for district to discuss way to improve retain teachers
13:18
and students so the challenge with that is that there's only one Sak meeting left
13:25
and Sak already has goals that have been predefined both shortterm and long-term
13:33
goals right we look at those goals and would you amend the mid year is the
13:40
first question that I have you trying to turn it off very thanks for including me
13:47
AJ um yeah Sak does have you know Six Bullets that they have to by law cover
13:54
by the last meeting we will have covered all six of those or enough that we and show evidence to the state that we've
14:00
covered those um as far as would that population of of individuals be willing
14:06
to meet in another format you know certainly we would have to ask them you couldn't add it to the same meeting
14:13
agenda yeah oh yeah that's I'm getting that like it's already a group of good committed committed individuals that are
14:20
giving their time to come and meet and yeah I couldn't guarantee I mean like like n said there's only one left so
14:26
would that be enough to get everything in but certainly I I can send communication out and see if they're
14:31
amable or have interest I think that would be the place to start is do they have interest in that so play Devil's
14:37
Advocate though is there any harm in creating a bigger cross-section if you already have people serving on a
14:42
committee there's certainly nothing that that would prevent them from Dual service but if if we are able to bring
14:50
in people who have not been selected by President principles rather um to work
14:55
on a separate but related issue we could also bring in more stakeholders to the conversation as a
15:02
whole is there harm in that I don't know if there's harm I don't know if there's a reason to reinvent the wheel if we
15:09
already have a format to do it do we know they're different Wheels though do we know if all four um
15:15
elementaries are represented on the S committee yeah preschool the four
15:22
elementaries and the three have parents from school yeah so that's the one thing
15:28
we would want to make sure that every school had representation and my other question so this says that the
15:33
recommendation would come to the board no later than April of 2026 so do we like how often is this
15:42
committee planning to meet that's entirely up to the committee
15:49
okay unless you want to put a a caveat in the resolution and I'm assuming that
15:54
we will hear from them before April 2026 um there should be something that says that they're going to provide yeah
16:00
regular updates regular updates so again that's something that we could put in there maybe it's quarterly updates maybe it's
16:08
semiannual my two cents Nick I appreciate the question I do think the sah committee with one meeting left has
16:14
kind of clear Focus goals this committee looks like it could run obviously throughout this year and
16:19
well into next year Sak's going to have another level of District goals and building goals I think many of these
16:27
things could be talked about maybe you could have people that are sharing at Sak about their progress and get
16:32
feedback the way me has at least outlined it here on on maybe the purpose and goals I do think that's probably a
16:39
separate kind of more specific animal to tackle than Sak I think you're just going to get different topics different
16:47
ideas maybe partnering with Sak but I just think this feels like they're going to
16:52
meet maybe a little more often a little more focused on specifics that I again this is your
16:58
your committee so I'm going to stay out what I can but being neutral right now I do think this feels like it's it's
17:05
tackling a different set of goals separate from Sak so I would be comfortable with a different committee
17:11
focusing on this work and having Sak over here maybe again intertwined as
17:17
necessary but kind of two separate animals or even having this committee
17:23
present to side act the information because when I think about information
17:29
we want good information going out to our community stakeholder groups right
17:36
accurate information and we have talked about there has been inaccurate
17:41
information and I think we all work very hard to dispel misinformation so the more people that
17:48
we could have informed straight from the horse's mouth the better and they potenti they potentially
17:56
could be a good sounding board point just three times next year um being able
18:02
to ask them hey what questions do you have what would you like inform that I mean there such anager
18:09
that's what I like I think point about an eager Bunch very hungry for good information so in whatever way that that
18:16
group can assist whether it's the same people we can again offer and ask them if they want to be a part of that we
18:35
so we obviously would would would like to have representative whether it's teachers or Specialists right um from
18:43
each one of those Elementary School uh buildings because this seems to be inherently a k through four issue what
18:52
role would we want from principles is a question that I have not
18:59
all principles serve on Sak right I think that they do rotating or is am I
19:04
wrong they do come to every meeting now that's been a change from the past but yeah okay that's good that's good so
19:11
then we would have some continuity and there they would be informed as to the work and the goals
19:18
and the practices of both committees I've had uh Deb kale would we
19:26
we spent a lot of time talking last week she would not not be interested in a chairperson role but would be interested
19:31
in serving um and then it would be just going to you know the April Patty and
19:40
Diane to see if maybe they one of them can kind of represent that group and again are there other staff members
19:46
parents Etc from the other buildings but and I would think that Patty would be
19:51
somebody who we would want because that is the she is the building that has the increasing fluctuating kindergarten
19:58
enrollment correct yes she's the one that we had to add the extra section
20:04
because she stated here last meeting that they will have 13 kids sign up two
20:09
weeks before school right yep so I can I can talk to
20:16
whomever or again the committee chair can talk to them you just we can tackle that
20:25
afterward Meg the Nea engagement guidelines could you just maybe walk us through how those work and and why um
20:34
this is this is a good fit for kind of the framework for this group um it the
20:40
Nea uh collaborative practice outline um was referenced at the iasb conference in
20:46
a few of the breakout sessions that I attended um it's also something that has been um heavily researched and
20:53
implemented at a lot of other districts with a lot of success um including dmps and water loop
21:00
um it also works really hard to work with um a variety of stakeholders in
21:07
districts right so it provides ways for administration or the board to speak to
21:12
parents or to speak to other community members um like you said last week it the um the guide book is it's lengthy
21:20
and it's it's chunky it's 259 Pages um but in that there is a lot of
21:26
information about creating not only um relationships but longer term successes
21:31
so in education you work on the scaffolding right you have to you have to build the framework first if we don't
21:37
have to reinvent the wheel and we can use someone else's framework for collaboration cross um populations then
21:44
I think that it would help our committee start like on the ground running we're
21:49
not going to have to say this is how we're going to I don't know um communicate effectively right no we're
21:56
going to literally take a page out of this book here's how we're communicating effectively um here's how we get other
22:02
engagement great don't have to like reinvent the wheel again or we don't have to um start completely from scratch
22:10
we can take a literal page out of this and use that since it's already been established um ISB does have some great
22:16
resources they're just not nearly as extensive or detailed so that's where the Nea comes in because that also does
22:21
help inform other like I said other districts and other um institutions that
22:28
have had great success with it yeah um it's just something I'm not necessarily
22:34
familiar with I think it's important that the group has some kind of organizational framework I think that's
22:41
um probably the responsibility of the chairperson to kind of help manage
22:46
um would you be comfortable Meg if we modified this to say um the committee
22:53
will use an organizational framework like the and and if that's the one you
22:59
end up using great but at least it gives you operational flexibility to say you know if this isn't for whatever reason
23:06
the right framework we're going to use something that keeps us organized um that U identifies action
23:13
items that tracks progress toward goals that type of thing so a research-based organizational framework yes I'll all it
23:34
you want that to be edited in the purpose well I was looking more under and maybe there's other places it's um
23:45
referenced yeah so it's in the purpose and then I think it's also under
23:50
collaborative improvement process second bullet down it's referenced or a subset of that
23:57
anyway is referenced [Applause]
24:03
um and then the chair person my thinking
24:09
was it would be somebody from the administrative team somebody that's got purview over the entire District okay
24:15
not necessarily superintendent or assistant superintendent well it could be them um it could be you know someone
24:22
else as well so um I don't know if you've got a suggestion there
24:28
or if it's a suggestion that we ask because some of that's probably
24:35
going to be based on um who maybe has the operating capacity to be able to get
24:41
in and do that um so according to the board policy it says the committee will select its
24:47
own chairperson unless the board designates otherwise so unless we are
24:52
yeah willing to make that very specific request um well maybe it could just be
24:59
as simple as the the committee will collaborate with the
25:04
superintendent uh to put forth a chairperson from the admin team
25:12
something in there's probably a more elegant way to word that but but that'
25:17
be the the concept is there a requisite to have the
25:23
administrative representative be the chairperson though that that's that's
25:28
honestly kind of a big ask for somebody in admin to take on to chair a committee that could be meeting very regularly
25:35
with a lot of data with a lot of Big Ideas to come through often that isn't
25:42
to say that I don't agree that we should have admin representative but you could have co-chairs you could have it's a lot
25:49
for a singular person in administration to shoulder I would think and and may
25:55
correct me if I'm wrong but my thinking was that a lot of the information that's going to be
26:02
requested would be the data of the school district or a lot of the data that that already is possessed within the school district that's and so my
26:08
thinking was that this person would be in a position to be able to kind of see all the Departments be able to also then
26:17
potentially have support staff uh available to them to help um you know um
26:23
delegate some of that kind of administrative responsibility of collecting information that's a good point yeah the last thing
26:30
we want is for them to have some inaccurate data since we've seen that happen already that's floating around out there so I would agree we need
26:37
someone an admin to be a part of that to make sure we're making our
26:42
recommendations based off accurate
26:49
information and then the only other comment I had is I think less is more I
26:54
think the more kind of I mean I think it's got enough Focus to say hey we're going to look at the elementary schools
27:01
it feels like you know um there was a lot of different ideas that were
27:07
discussed at the parent forum for example I think those are all very worthy things to look at year round
27:14
school um are there ways to you know kind of source enrollment because we offer something a differentiated service
27:21
from the other school districts around us the way that we provide um um day or preschool uh
27:31
transitional kindergarten I I think all of those things we've been talking
27:36
about dayong transitional kindergarten for a while it did come to the board uh that came up last time I I
27:44
don't know if anybody else was on the board when that came forward the last time the problem was we were in the middle of negotiations hadn't wrapped up
27:51
negotiations and that request came to the board so it wasn't I don't think that the board didn't support it it was
27:57
that request kind of came out of sequence relative to how we were trying to get uh the budget built for the
28:02
following year so uh and then it just never has come back to the board for discussion again so you know all good
28:09
things that I think you know some parents might find attractive um and and should should
28:15
probably be discussed but again I'm not sure there's
28:20
a tremendous amount of value in enumerating these things in the in the
28:26
resolution rather just kind of make sure that it's built in a way where they can dive into all of those things and then I
28:33
think the second thing is I think we've seen parents from around the district you know kind of raise their hand and
28:38
say hey this is something I'm interested and I want to participate in so I think you know
28:45
the I don't know if you reach a point where the group gets large enough that
28:50
um that it's difficult I don't know um but maybe then that's where you spend
28:55
people off in the subcommittees or those types of things it's been my experience anyway it's it's hard to find people
29:01
that are willing to you know donate a tremendous amount of time but um maybe
29:06
that uh maybe that'll be different with this group so those those were my comments I don't
29:13
know if there's does anyone know off the top of their heads how big Sak is I was just goingon to say we have a very large
29:19
group at Sak yeah there's I'm going to guess 50 to 60 Nam holy cra I bet you 60
29:29
to 70 if we have everybody listed because that includes parents
29:35
administrators district and building uh we have students involved at the secondary level and then we also have
29:42
community members or can have community members what group would I be missing
29:47
parents students community members yeah it's I mean we we don't get that large of a group every time because activities
29:53
are busy um I think being clear
29:59
and I'm not giving advice I the last person to this but having facilitated groups like this now for many years
30:05
being really clear about maybe a number of times so people can start to clear their calendars and be president and
30:12
then I do find the more the better I mean there can be two large of groups
30:17
depending on what decision making is happening but um because people have
30:22
activities and storms and things that can throw you know the schedule off having more people because they'll EB
30:28
and flow is
30:34
important for the leadership component um it currently reads the chairperson shall be appointed by the committee I
30:41
find the idea of a co-chair really attractive I feel like that if nothing
30:47
else shows a willingness to um partner thank you to to bridge
30:54
that conversation between parents or stakeholders and the administration in the
30:59
district so is there any advice or commentary on how to word
31:06
that so Meg Co you'd say there'd be a chair and a co-chair or there would just
31:11
be two chair people coach I I guess I would think
31:18
that there would be two co-chairs but open to conversation regarding that
31:34
I think Ryan made some really valid points about us wanting to be able to have somebody in the district who can
31:41
access data that is not accessible to the general public um Monica also
31:48
mentioned the need for it to be accurate factual data and I think that those are two really great points
31:55
um I do think that there is something to be said about having the committee
32:00
though select somebody who demonstrates leadership in that role
32:09
um and then obviously I think it's important that Dr Bloom be a part
32:14
of the committee because you're the Visionary for where we're going
32:20
right yeah I I will do whatever this group wants and I will very kind of selfishly tell you I wouldn't mind with
32:27
this committee being a step removed um Greg and I are kind of in the weeds all
32:33
the time we're we're the ones kind of having all these conversations with families on both sides so I mean if if
32:41
you said you have to pick one person right now to represent the district I would my recommendation would be Carrie
32:46
jman HR um he's got a history here but then left so he's got a unique
32:52
experiences in other districts um Works closely with Michelle on budget stuff
32:58
can get to Greg and I anytime and just is building principle time I just think there's a lot of winds there and I
33:03
almost wonder if Greg and I are kind of in the trees too much but you guys I mean you tell me I'll do whatever
33:09
you want but again I wouldn't mind being a resource more than a in every meeting having these
33:15
discussions I have no problem with Carrie or a co-chair says Bloom here's what we need from you following this
33:21
meeting I can come present I can but again car's kind of a maybe a nice
33:29
neutral here but not in it so much yet that his experience may lead to helping
33:35
lead this group with some neat ideas and and Greg and I get to play teammates
33:40
versus facil in it every day yeah I think and it's kind of like I don't want Nancy I appreciate it very much I just
33:46
want everyone to feel like they got to turn to me all the time and you know can we do that should we do that like no
33:52
like let me get out of the way you guys get creative you don't need my permission right now so let me be a
33:59
resource instead of well if you're not facilitating then you could be listening yeah right Y and Mr jman would be our HR
34:06
person that would speak a bit to staff retention yeah he would yep he would have access to all you would need him
34:12
yep how do you feel about that Mr J it needs to be daily meetings daily
34:18
meetings every night you're hearing about need track shoes instead of go um
34:23
so would it be appropriate for us or bloom to I mean he obviously just did
34:29
nominate Carrie so congrats um but then the committee once formed appoint their
34:37
co-chair is there any okay now this is semantics and this is Devil's Advocate
34:42
semantics like I coachers are great but is there any harm in just saying that the committee composition
34:48
requires Mr jman to be part of the committee like I don't it's not
34:54
something where like we're voting on like they're going to be voting on things or having like administrative
34:59
power it's mostly in the way of recommendations organization and recommendations to the board so I mean
35:07
do you want to be a co-chair or do you just want to be like on the committee I your
35:16
recommendation well [Laughter] played so so Meg I just want to make
35:24
sure I understand um the the concept of of why we want to
35:31
nominate another chairperson again so that we're Bridging the Gap between the the community
35:36
involvement in the administration so it would reasonably then the other person that would be a a
35:43
a chairperson would be outside the school district
35:48
correct but potentially a parent with kids in the school district absolutely a Community member someone who lives in
35:56
the area and has a vested interest in
36:04
this taxpayers and people that we didn't talk
36:11
about who we would maybe want to consider because of director MC's point
36:16
do we want to invite a representative from Dallas Center and Grimes from the city yeah I think that's important that
36:23
you have you know I and the little bit I understand about this um Nea framework
36:33
was the best I could understand it it was it was designed to kind of bring District
36:40
Community local government at times um together and so that seemed re I that
36:47
was just kind of something I thought would would naturally happen obviously we've had engagement
36:53
from both um both City Council you know obviously in different ways but
37:02
um yeah I mean that seems to be pretty important I I think if if yeah I mean if
37:08
we're going to talk about Community Focus it would be nice if people from the I mean there's somebody here today I
37:15
believe that's on one but if we get the city council like involved I think that's great um I think Carrie I mean
37:20
I'd be comfortable with that and I think if we're talking about retaining teachers I think his experience his
37:26
multiple roles I would feel comfortable honestly when I when I think about a co-chair I think that just starts to get
37:32
messy personally I'm open to whatever but I think I would feel comfortable
37:37
with this new format carry leading it HR perspective trying to get as many people obviously as we can from both sets of
37:45
the city because obviously there's an economic component here um and I think if we have a well-rounded board that
37:51
represents the entire Community um Carry leading it um and I think I would feel
37:57
comfortable with
38:05
that car I'm looking at your face this this is not negotiation this is as Duty
38:11
as a sign like this is this is just happening
38:17
accept and the root of the problem is enrollment right that's why we're this kind of where this all spurred from MH
38:22
and so like we probably need to add something to the duties because it doesn't really it talks about asset
38:28
but doesn't really ever mention the the main problem which we
38:33
need to is to grow our enrollment both D Center end and GES
38:43
both I think that the main driver right I think that
38:50
um so one of the issues that Ryan had with the previous document was that it
38:55
was too narrow it was too narrow I think that this leaving this a little
39:01
bit more broad um gets you to enrollment by looking at
39:07
um how we are approaching our best practices how are we serving the students that we do have how do we
39:13
attract more students how are we developing Equitable budget proposals and sustainable resources all of these
39:20
things are what we need to look at in order to make enrollment happen
39:26
so yes the driving point or like the the driving focus is to enroll more students
39:32
um but if I feel like if we set out with a committee that says we're here to improve enrollment a lot of things that
39:41
are outside of our control but are outlined here um lead to increased
39:48
enrollment does that make sense like we can't just like go out we can't go out with a clipboard and say hey please
39:54
register for our school we have to work on ways to attract people I think that's what Ryan and Dr Bloom are saying last
40:01
week yeah we that's that's the hard part we can't it's the marketing yeah we're hinging on on our cities to help develop
40:08
the land to get the housing here which back to point yeah the meantime we need to
40:15
decide a blip right now we're going through a little bit of a blip of enrollment which we think is going to come
40:21
back not if people aren't having kids not if people aren't building houses in
40:26
the general area not if people are leaving the state or if we're up against vouchers or we're up
40:32
against whatever it is that we're going to be up against we need to figure out how to strengthen the district as a
40:38
whole so that we are not necessarily I mean I don't think you can ever be completely blip resilient or blip proof
40:45
but certainly be stronger so that when the blips do happen we don't necessarily
40:50
have to go into the credit card or we don't necessarily have to well I think what we're talking about is just having the opportunity to have houses built I
40:56
think that's I think uh the city council her name is Amy strut one more time I
41:02
think they alluded to that that they're they are doing we are developments going so that's going to help B time yeah
41:08
that's we didn't we haven't had that in the past so like now we have a finding chance to get some enrollment numbers up yeah but
41:15
we're also working off of projections and numbers that were just frankly not
41:20
accurate for a variety of reasons correct I mean our fiveyear project and I forgive me it the company named
41:27
escapes mean RSP RSP right and they showed that even this year we were
41:33
supposed to be trending correct upward um and
41:40
so obviously we need to reanalyze that
41:45
correct and that's one component right we've shown for the last five years we
41:50
would be going up we're not you know the interesting thing about RSP is up until
41:57
recently they had been accurate within you said within 1% within a fraction of 1% correct so you know they're are
42:05
pretty good group it might be interesting as and I don't know if we've talked with them recently we used to I
42:11
think engage them every other year Michelle is that
42:16
correct cont okay yeah and is that contract
42:24
still active okay they were just here in July that
42:30
when they were here well and they'll come back like you know even if it's scheduled every other year we can get
42:36
him well it just might be interesting to you know I mean look I think they'd be probably the first to admit yeah this
42:42
wasn't right and it wasn't right for not just you guys it wasn't right for a lot of schol a lot of districts but my guess
42:48
is they're good enough at this they've probably started to make some adjustments or tell us why right I mean
42:56
that's what you're alluding to and I'm not trying to insult that company yeah no
43:01
um yeah I mean there's there's something yeah there was something in
43:07
the way that they traditionally had collected data and put it into their model that gave relatively accurate
43:13
outcomes that changed I guess is they've probably done the research and have some sense as to why have they made a
43:21
correction you know what have we had those conversations what's that have we had those conversations with them we
43:27
certainly had the conversations about obviously the inaccuracies they will have an updated one if not end of this
43:33
month probably early to mid April they'll have their next kind of round of here's where we're going yep so we'll
43:40
get we'll get new numbers here in the near future y yeah well that I mean that
43:48
feels like really a really good set of data to have a conver you know a joint
43:53
conversation between representative from the districts the community in in student in city council rather um from
44:01
both communities okay well as a matter of is there any
44:10
other um comments any other suggestions and then if there are we'll take those
44:16
in a second and then what I thought we could potentially do is just step through each of these make sure that
44:24
we've got General agreement around how we proceed and then um we'll try to move
44:30
ourselves along to um to vote if that seems okay to everyone any other comments before we
44:36
move along to that okay um the opening statement um or
44:43
the the the way that the resolution opens is the Dallas intergr School Board seeks to establish criteria for
44:49
Effective Elementary School programming throughout the school district
44:57
M any okay okay uh structured approach is eminently
45:06
needed to assess and enhance programs that attract and retain teachers and
45:11
students to Dallas Center Grimes Community School
45:17
District moving along um this is one area where I think we talked about a
45:23
research based framework I.E the Nea framework uh as mentioned here
45:32
provides an established um methodology for
45:37
Ed educ education educational Improvement
45:43
planning new word yeah one of
45:50
people it's that kind of so I've updated that wording to the researched whereas the researched organizational framework
45:56
such as Nea framework provides an established methodology for educational Improvement planning sounds good to me
46:02
okay yep okay the Dallas Center Grim School Board hereby establishes an ad hoc committee
46:08
with the following specifications purpose uh to use relevant components
46:15
from I updated that to such as yeah to identify a long-term plan that could
46:21
potentially be implemented by the 26 27 school year for identifying programs and resource resources that will both
46:27
attract and retain teachers and students to dcg all good there if we're coming so at
46:38
the end it says that the comprehensive recommendation will be delivered to the
46:43
school board by April 2026 so from April to August good call I
46:48
don't think that's enough time to implement something no that's a good call that's why you need lots of back
46:53
Checkers so 20 7 to 28 school year is that what you're
47:00
thinking yeah I'm not old enough to write those numbers I'm just going to put that out
47:06
there it's not
47:12
[Applause] possible are there any specifics in any of the duty bullet points that we need
47:19
to update I just had that one reference in bullet to under collaborative I
47:25
updated that to facilitate regular community input sessions like Nea engagement
47:31
guidelines such as as referenced do you have a particular phrasing you like
47:38
best no that's that works okay anything
47:44
else the leadership and the committee composition so we've talked a lot about what we would like to see on a committee
47:50
composition my fear in um putting too fine of a point on requirements for that
47:58
um could that that could um could prove
48:04
problematic if you are going to force the issue of we need we absolutely have to have a member from Grimes city
48:11
council and from Dallas Center City Council and literally nobody from the state wants to participate in this then
48:16
the committee cannot move forward and we would have to revisit it um so I
48:22
wouldn't necessarily want to put heavy requirements on that but we're all operating under the understanding that we are going to do our very best to have
48:28
a balanced cross-section of the entire District
48:34
um I agree a designated board member you can have up to three board members
48:40
though on the committee before you have a quorum so I don't NE think that necessarily needs to be noted here
48:46
just you know just for the greater good do you want me to take it out no I think
48:51
how it's written is fine I just I think you could have more than one board member is but you can't have
48:58
more than three well we can have more than three we just have to be exceptionally careful because we had
49:03
more than three show up for the facilities committee meeting we just didn't talk to each other we didn't sit by each other same thing with the parent
49:10
meeting right that's true and we said we did like a disclaimer beforehand to make
49:15
sure like I think don't you get into open meeting laws like I you that's the same you just have to be can't talk to
49:21
each other though right you're you're exactly saying what I just said y but we don't have three on or we don't have
49:26
more than three on Sak so we don't ever run into an issue yeah typically we try not so like that was you know we had
49:34
certainly you know we had more than three at the Forum you know were're careful there you know at the that was
49:41
kind of a readout from OPN we don't routinely have more than three at the facilities committee so you know um I
49:49
would just say you know in in terms of you know actual members that are collaborating and
49:57
working together we should be careful not to have more than three
50:05
okay and then leadership here the chairperson
50:11
um shall be a representative of the Dallas Cent Grimes administrative team or something like that and again I would
50:18
just leave that as vague as you could and then work with Dr Bloom to sounds
50:24
like it's be are we are
50:29
we I would not put his name in the res no absolutely not that is that is element number one of being as vague as
50:36
possible I would like to throw in one more time that I think a co-chair from the community or from the stakeholders
50:43
would go a long way in the court of public opinion does that have to be in this document or can they just decide
50:50
once there's a chairperson that you're going to add a co-chair once the committee is formed I think it should be
50:56
in in the document but in the committee composition piece
51:04
can we just add that the committee will vote on a
51:10
co-chair so under leadership it should say there will
51:16
be co-chair positions one filled by an admin
51:24
representative and one appointed by the Comm that work [Music]
51:31
mhm he Dallas
51:37
Center admin rep and one appointed by the committee okay there will be two
51:45
co-chair positions one filled by Dallas andar Grimes Community School District Administrative rep representative and
51:51
one appointed by the committee
51:58
any problems with that if everybody's okay I just think it might be messy but
52:05
I mean I'm I'm assuming you're saying that because you said Court of public opinion
52:11
because we want to look like hey we value you and you have a SE table running this and we are absolutely
52:17
working with you as part of this so for me I think what Dr Bloom said about removing himself from that and putting
52:24
the HR representative I think for at least for me fulfills that if everybody else wants a co-chair I would if I was
52:30
going to pick I'd rather have one versus you start adding those things I think it gets messy I'm cool with everything else
52:37
we talked about but I think that one if I was to pick I would rather not have a co-chair um
52:50
by have a strong opinion on it one way or the other I don't and I don't care either way I just think it's G be messy
52:56
the way I think about there's two there's two two ways to think about it one you know the committee needs to meet
53:02
having two people that can run the meeting if one person's unavailable or sick or something you know that's a
53:08
benefit what you you want to prevent is um having a situation where you could
53:15
potentially have conflict between sh people and that could um what not be the
53:22
the kind of experience that we're hopeful to have the committee members have so that's just the the the two
53:29
places I go is there's there's benefit and what if you did something like we do
53:34
here we have a president and a vice president when you're not able to be here Monica can step in facilitate the meeting so you just and I think it's the
53:40
same concept that's why you know Co I think there's as many if you use blooms both Sid a little
53:47
you know keep score both ways I think it's kind of at the very least the committee can also create some sort of
53:53
hierarchy of their own but having representatives from like I said the administration and the community or
53:59
parents or whoever and then if they say hey we'd like to have like we're going to have a president vice president but
54:05
then we're also going to have you know subcommittees that all have equal saying something or whatever and and if we have
54:13
subcommittees you would have subcommittee leaders that could be designated by the committee as well
54:19
right to go down certain Pathways to investigate certain issues to report back to the overall ad hoc committee
54:26
like they're essentially governing themselves as they're doing a lot of This research like they're not going to
54:32
come to us and say this committee isar and you know we have to sort out conflicts likely
54:39
I think there are plenty of um steps in between them and us that we would have
54:45
to deal with so in other boards or committees that I serve on we do have a provision
54:53
where we say um if you don't come to a certain and you have a leadership role
55:00
to a certain number of me meetings we will remove you and replace you with
55:06
someone um just to it signify the importance like if you miss for board
55:12
meetings in a row you're not really invested in what's going on here and we
55:18
are going to find someone to fill your role do we need that's that that's a good point how much how many times did
55:23
this committee meet that is entirely up to them
55:30
I think we might be getting a little too far in the weeds with that is 100% how I feel about I I just didn't know if that
55:36
was something before we move into a motion area do we need to go down that path or do we think that that's
55:42
something that would be established by the that group with their agendas and their norms and 100 let them figure that
55:50
out okay I'm fine with the coach
55:56
peace me too yep okay and then um we just talk about
56:05
it regular updates I there's regular updates and then there's another place
56:11
in in here that said I think quarterly yeah quarterly it says somewhere so we should probably just make those two
56:17
things say the same thing whether that's regular or whether that's quarterly do
56:23
you have a preference a regular leaves it more vag and than I think
56:30
where is quarterly oh there you go thank
56:41
you okay name for it is it going to have a name they're going to name it themselves
56:47
um the way that I read that though is conduct quarterly data analysis it doesn't necessarily
56:53
say I thought it I guess it says present okay nope you're right you're right you're
57:03
right okay conduct regular data analysis
57:10
it's do you want to go through one more time just to make sure we're all on the same page one more time or I'm
57:18
comfortable yep yeah could you would email we have three minutes before Michelle's
57:24
presentation start do that right now she's doing right a time is there oh hold on PDF download as a
57:31
PDF I got it I'm going to while Meg does that if you're okay I'm going to move us
57:36
along uh do we have a motion move to approve ad hoc committee
57:43
second Vander any more discussion all those in favor indicate
57:48
by saying I I I post same sign motion
