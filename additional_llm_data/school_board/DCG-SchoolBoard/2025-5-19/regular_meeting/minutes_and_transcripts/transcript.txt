Um, item eight is a presentation by the city of Dallas Center. Uh, I don't know
2:26
if we have some folks here from from Dallas Center. Thank you for joining us this evening.
2:32
Yeah, we're gonna have to talk super loud. Hi everybody. Uh, my name is Danny Byer. I
2:39
am the sitting mayor of Dallas Center and this is the wonderful John Cook, our city administrator. uh was invited to
2:46
come tonight and just share what the city has been doing as far as developments and what we are doing to
2:51
attract residents to the community itself. Over the past 10 years that I've served on council and as mayor, uh we've
2:58
worked hard to create a city that's welcoming to young families. That includes doubling the size of the library, uh, building the brand new
3:05
pool, all without needing to use TIFF dollars and a lot of tax dollars on purpose because we understand tax
3:12
abatements and tiff and how that works in conjunction with what you all are doing. And that is what we continue to
3:17
do in the community to this day. Since John has come on, he's been a breath of fresh air as far as potential
3:24
developments, as far as working with commercial buildings and commercial build or commercial owners. And we are
3:31
still currently working with several developers to hopefully get roofs built, to get houses up, to get kids to the
3:38
community to help support not only our elementary but the district as a whole. With that, John has all of those numbers
3:44
and all of that information in his head. So, I'm going to give him the microphone to go over those pieces. All right.
3:51
Thank you. I owe you 20 bucks. Uh so, as uh Mayor Ber said, my name is John Cook.
3:56
I'm the new city administrator. July 10th will be my first year totally in the office. Uh came from De Moine. Uh
4:03
before that uh we've been working with uh three different developments that we have and then a fourth uh idea has come
4:10
online. I'll talk a little bit about that in a second. Uh three developments that we have that are approved, ready to
4:16
go. We are literally waiting on earth to start moving. Uh Berquette Platt, uh the
4:22
Sky View development, and then the neighborhood plat. If you're just looking for geography or want to follow along on Google Maps, uh, go out 44 and
4:30
when you hit Fair View, you can go north or south. And they're all clustered on that northeast quadrant of what I kind
4:37
of refer to as Oldtown Dallas Center. So, the core uh, of Dallas Center. Uh, when built out fully, uh, we will double
4:46
the number of homes that we have, uh, in Dallas Center. So, we will literally double in size with the housing. Uh like
4:53
I said, we're just kind of waiting on earth to move. We've offered uh different incentives to get them going,
4:58
specifically tax abatements to the Burquette Plat because they are building entrylevel homes for those young
5:04
families and those tax abatements go to those uh home buyers and kind of help ease that shock of buying into the
5:11
housing market as you know we've seen postcoid. Um when all those are built out, like I said, we will double the
5:17
number of homes of Dallas Center. But, uh, building on the great work that I inherited with the pool and also with
5:23
the library, uh, we've just rolled out a plan, uh, to revitalize our downtown
5:29
core. Uh, no offense, Grimes, but we're looking to have the prettiest, uh, charming downtown in all of Iowa. Uh,
5:37
and so, uh, we've got a plan now to extend Walnut Street all the way to Fair View, where it currently doesn't
5:43
connect. Uh so that will be easy to drive right out that way. Go a little bit south, go a little bit west, and
5:49
you're downtown into our revitalized core with some new buildings that we have uh made solid uh because some of
5:55
them are 100red years old plus. Uh made them pretty uh redone the face and made
6:00
them more appealing to for storefronts and then ultimately made them occupied. Uh once we've done that, we've got some
6:06
other ideas including expanding the interior heritage park and turning uh the uh solar panel facade that we have
6:13
now into an amphitheater. Uh so when we uh do homecoming parades in downtown
6:19
Dallas Center, which we'd love to have and love to keep, uh that we've got a place to crown king and queen there in
6:24
an amphitheater. across the street. We've got a really crazy idea brought by this wild city administrator that they
6:31
hired for no reason uh to build the or to put in the largest piece of public art uh in Iowa, something that we could
6:38
use to draw people downtown. So, all part of that kind of that downtown corridor. Uh we are also just kind of
6:44
looping back to housing. We're currently studying the ADU bill that was just signed by the governor. Um, that one we
6:51
feel we're waiting for some legislative language to kind of get sorted out of what that will translate into
6:56
ordinances. Uh, and then I've got a group kind of waiting in the wings to study that and look at what uh, ADUs
7:03
might look like. For those of you who don't know, ADU is accessory dwelling unit. Uh, it's tiny homes. Uh, which if
7:09
anybody's seen HGTV for more than five minutes, uh, or grandmother units. Uh so
7:15
we've got a lot of those old fun rambling farmhouses um and you know one
7:20
or two people living in them. This possibly opens up the potential for building an ADU on that site. They can
7:27
downsize and something that's more manageable that's single level, opening up that uh big rambling farmhouse for a
7:34
rental potentially. Uh we're also kind of looking at the idea of building a division or subdivision. This is way
7:40
down the line, but of ADUs for older folks who want to downsize into something that's still independent but a
7:48
little more manageable. Um, so, uh, those are kind of the projects that we
7:53
have working. Anything else you want to hit on, boss? No, the only thing that I would add is Spurgeon Manor is also
7:59
currently looking to add 60 to 100 more town homes, which also would help along
8:04
with that ADU development to move hopefully people out of those larger homes into independent living and free
8:11
those up for young families to come in as well. So, that's what we're working on.
8:17
Yeah, lots of good stuff.
8:22
Good. What questions from the board? And we made the rain stop. Yeah. Very good
8:28
job. Yeah. Almost immediately after you started speaking, by the way, that was pretty impressive. I used to work in a
8:34
church. I just three sides. Where where's the
8:40
other two at? You said the one was Are they all right in the same intersection? Okay. They're all just different quadrants of that. Yep.
8:47
To clarify for those listening at home, when we say we're doing the tax abatements for the one development, it's only on the first 75,000. We're doing
8:54
the least amount of tax abatements possible. We're not falling into the
8:59
decrepit, abandoned, those types of tax abatements. So, this is not something that's going to drastically hurt income
9:05
to the school or to the city. Is there any idea of like which quadrant out there you guys are going to be, I guess,
9:12
developing sooner, or is it all up to the developers at this point? It's up to the developers at this point. We're kind
9:18
of watching the Burquette, which is the one with tax abatements, along with Sky View at the same time because we have
9:23
offered and we are partnering with them on some infrastructure builds. And so they both have real incentives to get
9:29
going. It's one of those whoever puts the uh shovel in the ground first will
9:35
likely then kickstart the other three because they'll feel like they're behind.
9:44
As someone with a vested interest in Dallas Center and Walnut Street, um I appreciate your willingness to entertain
9:52
um crazy ideas or um out of the box thinking in order to help revitalize the
9:58
community, but also to attract the families. And from my school board member hat, um clearly having those
10:05
younger families and bringing the kids in not only does really great things for our community and our city, but it does really great things for our district,
10:11
especially when we're staring down declining enrollment numbers not just in Dallas center but as a district. So
10:17
thank you for your creative thinking and your willingness to do crazy things. Of course. Thank you both for being here.
10:24
Two quick clarifying questions for me team. Are the three the Berquette Sky View and the other one? Sorry I missed
10:30
that one. Are those together going to be able to double the size the goal of the Dell
10:35
Center or is that like that's a pocket and then here's another pocket or those three projects together could
10:40
potentially bring double the houses. Those three projects equate to more than 600 homes and that's where we're
10:46
sitting. That together is the 600. That's awesome. So, you're just kind of waiting for them to rock. Yep. Awesome.
10:51
We're doing everything but pick up hammers and y and that's our next council work session.
11:00
Well, I reached out to these gentlemen. We're going to have uh the Grimes folks come next month. These guys were
11:06
gracious enough. Can you just give us five or 10 minutes? Give us the update. Let you folks ask some questions. So, I
11:11
appreciate you both for what you do and for taking the time tonight to kind of walk us through how we're we're a team
11:18
in this. So, appreciate it very much. Thanks for the invite. And we both know we're not the smartest people in the room. So, if you all have any ideas, as
11:25
Meg said, as John said, we are up for creativity. We're up for ideas. If there's something you see that we're
11:31
missing, don't sit on it. Reach out. Let us know. Send a note. Grab coffee. Happy
11:37
to sit down at LightBrite or at Sugar Grove Goods. Y I do have a quick
11:42
question. Um I know a year or so ago we had some water issues at the schools. So building these houses, is it is the
11:48
infrastructure ready for that? Is that an issue at all we see with the school? Super fair
11:54
question. Um where we're looking right now, all of that has been run off to the
12:00
new retention pond that has been built. So that's where that is all going. Um
12:05
there is possible developments that could happen. And there are developers who own the land directly across the
12:11
street from the school. Okay. And so as that comes online, then we'll be looking at those possibilities. But that's
12:18
something when I got on council and became mayor was very aware of and
12:24
didn't want to see issues with by the time I'm done. So
12:31
awesome, Danny. John, thank you very much. Appreciate your leadership and giving us an update this evening. Thank you all. have a good meeting. Uh RSP, do
12:40
we have uh is RSP here yet? Oh, there she is. Yeah, great.
12:58
Good evening, board. My name is Jenna Wallace with RSP. Um I've been a planner with RSP about four years now. So, I'm
13:04
going to go through your updated 2425 enrollment analysis. I know you
13:10
guys have received um similar reports in the past, so I'll try to keep this fairly high level, but then enough room
13:17
um for you guys to ask any questions and we can dig into any specific data points at the end. Um so, the report like similar
13:25
reports is broken down into our four main parts and goes through the different expectations and study
13:30
elements of the variables. So the four parts that I'll go through
13:36
is part one our enrollment and demographics, part two our development and growth trends and then how those um
13:43
two key really pillars of a data lead to our most likely enrollment projections
13:48
and then some different next steps considerations for you all.
13:55
So the executive summary of this year's report, we do have the district forecasted to continue to grow. And so
14:02
we have growth of about 300 students. Um and the greatest levels are either at elementary or high school with a bit
14:09
more of the stabilization in the middle school grades. Um some of those key
14:14
variables are looking at the uptick of housing potential that we're looking at right now. um as well as some different
14:21
positive um indicators of future growth in the middle grades as greater migration moves into the
14:30
community. So going into here for our uh part one, we have a lot of different maps in
14:38
the report. This first visual is looking at your district boundary. And so looking at um your entire district and
14:44
our main two communities um between our different city boundaries and the location of our
14:51
facilities and then our current elementary boundary maps. And so looking at um the three different uh boundaries
14:58
broken up on the grime side as well as the county line being the major um break before our Dallas Center Elementary
15:04
School. The next visual here goes into the
15:11
methodology of our model. And so if I flipped back to that first visual of your giant kind of amoeba like boundary,
15:19
um it's a really large and there's a lot of different pockets of density. And so what we do with our model is break it
15:25
down to those bite-sized pieces that we call planning areas. And so each neighborhood, each apartment complex is
15:32
one planning area. and we can say how many students live there, how many houses, what's the price of houses, um
15:38
what's the turnover rate. So then we can better project what's going to be future happening in those different planning
15:45
areas. And so this visual you can track one green line would be one planning area and the yellow lines are a census
15:52
block. So we're more granular than the census gets with data and this helps us have a better accuracy planning for each
15:59
household. And so the model here is a statistical
16:05
model. So we're feeding it all the best data that we have, pushing out that most likely
16:12
forecast. And the model here almost kind of works like a seessaw where some variables are greater indicators of
16:18
growth while some variables are limitators of growth. And so we're taking all that information um using
16:25
past historic as well as future change to project how do these different indicators and limitations um map out to
16:32
that most likely forecast. So one of our key variables
16:38
that we look at for elementary and kindergarten enrollment is our birth rate data. And so these graphics are PK
16:46
county and Dallas County birth rate information. We have been seeing a slightly lower live birth rate in the
16:54
district and that has correlated with a decreasing population of under five
17:00
years of age. And so thinking about with less babies being born has a bit smaller
17:06
of a population of that potential age group doesn't mean that it's necessarily
17:11
a decrease, but it means that you have to continue to increase your market share of future kids to continue and see
17:18
that stable kindergarten and prek enrollment. Um, it's one of those kind of demographic limitations that we're
17:24
mapping out. We're also pulling your past enrollment
17:30
by grade. And so this is looking at just K12 of your official count enrollment.
17:37
And so tracking within these grades um seeing some slight increases the past
17:42
couple of years. Um some of the other main takeaways from this year's
17:47
enrollment is our two grades that are above 300 students. And so we're mapping closer and closer to that kind of 280 to
17:55
300 students per grade. Your largest grade right now is in 9th grade. And so
18:01
that's a large class that's looking in those upper middle and high school grades that are going to be moving
18:07
forward. But the smallest class this year is 11th grade. And so as smaller grades graduate and bigger grades come
18:14
in, that's a direct correlation with some future growth planned. Another main
18:19
kind of rule of thumb is comparing that incoming kindergarten class to your exiting 12th grade class. And so this
18:27
year you can see that we had 281 kindergarten students. And that's a really great indicator of greater growth
18:34
as that kindergarten class fully replaces um the 12th grade class as well
18:39
as it's larger than you have to go all the way back to 201920
18:45
um to have a similar kindergarten class. And so, um, that kind of lower kindergarten class that was experienced
18:51
the past three years, you guys have come back up from that with this year's
18:58
data. The other thing to think about when you're looking at district-wide growth is comparing that kindergarten
19:04
versus 12th grade and then also looking at what is the trend cohort to cohort to
19:09
increase students. Um, and so most of your cohorts this year have increased and they tend to do do that. So the
19:16
large longer you're in the school district, the larger your grades get moving throughout the system. Really
19:21
only fifth to sixth grade and kind of 9th to 11th grade cohorts have a tendency um to decrease slightly. So
19:28
we're also modeling for those grade cohorts to decrease a little
19:35
bit. The next thing that we look at is your migration trend. And so those orange bars are going to be new students
19:42
coming into the district this year. versus the green is past students that
19:48
um transferred out of state, private, parochial, homeschool, something like that that they've exited the system. And
19:55
so in this case, for the past 3 years, the students that you guys had as
20:00
students that left were fully replaced by new students coming in. So creating a net growth of migration, which is a very
20:08
positive indicator of future growth. The other thing that we've started analyzing
20:14
with this variable for other um Iowa school districts that we work with is
20:20
the kind of phase in plan with the education savings account and how big of
20:25
an impact does it have on your district's enrollment. And in that case,
20:30
we would be able to see in those green bars and the out migration if it increased drastically, then likely there
20:37
were students in your community um that now have that ESA to go to some other private parochial
20:43
options. But in this case, you can see for that top bar for elementary, our out
20:49
migration decreased. And then at the middle and the high school, um it was very fairly consistent with past years.
20:56
So even though there might be an increase of students using ESAs in the district, they're most likely students
21:03
that were already in the private parochial setting and not necessarily um students that were in your district. If
21:10
we saw that increase dramatically, that would be something else, but we're not seeing that right now. But we know it
21:16
gets fully phased in um next year. So we're just going to continue to monitor that.
21:25
[Music] Um, perfect. Thank you. All right. So,
21:31
the next variable here is our out of district and open enrollment analysis. So, we're looking at the student
21:37
population that resides out of the district boundary. We enroll around 380
21:43
to 400 students from surrounding school districts. And Johnston Community C or
21:48
community um school district has that greatest contributor of our outofd district enrollment. This year we did
21:55
see kind of Johnston as well as Walke School District increase in our open enrollment um creating that 424 total
22:04
students residing from out of the district boundary. Something that we're tracking here for sure is that
22:10
relationship of out of district enrollment to newly developed um
22:15
households that are really near the district boundary and close to um other facilities. So on the north side with
22:22
some of those new subdivisions that are technically in Johnston School District but very close um to your elementary
22:28
buildings having a greater pull from that way. Um but then on the flip side
22:33
down on the south side with some um new uh subdivisions that are might be closer
22:38
to like Waterford Elementary and Walke. So there's kind of this balance of in and out when we're looking at
22:44
subdivisions built on that periphery and actual school locations.
22:52
And then the next two maps here go through just the population density of the district. And so in this case, we're
22:58
looking at count change. The orange areas would be the neighborhoods that have increased in student count versus
23:05
the green is the neighborhoods that have decreased. And so we have different pockets of households that have either
23:11
increased, they have new families moving in versus maybe there's some aging in place and some turnover that's not
23:17
happening that's creating some decrease of our student count. So we're mapping out in each neighborhood in each
23:22
planning area what's happening as well as just analyzing our
23:28
total student density in the district. And so you can really see the pocket of the majority of our students um there on
23:34
the east side. But then our next pocket of density around Dallas
23:40
Center. And so that goes through and builds kind of the framework of the enrollment and demographic data. You can
23:47
see most of these are key indicators of student growth. Really the only limitation is that demographic trend of
23:54
less live births and that decreasing population. Not unique. We're seeing it kind of everywhere with millennials. Um,
24:00
but something that we just want to continue to analyze as we think of increasing our market share to maintain
24:06
that kindergarten enrollment. So then moving into part
24:12
two, we look at development and population. And so this graphic is
24:17
looking at a correlation between those three indicators. And so the green line at the top is new persons, the
24:24
population increase into the community. And so you guys are seeing around 400 to
24:29
500 new people move into the district these past couple of years. The blue
24:35
line is our new building activity, new certificates of occupancy. And so we
24:40
have seen a decrease in the amount of units being built the past couple of years. um some different subdivisions
24:47
that are kind of at the tail end of wrapping up um that we've had this kind of decreasing of less than 100 units.
24:55
You can really see these past three years where we be built 79, 28, and 60
25:01
units. All that together, the past three years, we're not even kind of close to
25:06
what we were building back in 2016 to 2019. And so that kind of limitation of
25:12
our housing is correlating with that lower enrollment growth that we have seen the past couple of
25:20
years. And so then we also look at the relationship between our housing units
25:25
and our student population in a yield rate analysis. So how many students do a
25:30
typical household in your district generate? And we show this per 100 units. So it's um kind of a closer of a
25:38
whole number instead of you know 0.5. And so in this case we're looking at the purple bars being our single family
25:44
inventory. And so on average your district generates 59 students per 100
25:50
single family homes. So a very high yield rate of the inventory that you guys have. And it's been very stable. So
25:57
the households that were even being built right now generate and attract a similar number of students than what you
26:03
guys had seen um 10 years ago of what you guys are seeing today. The blue bars is our multifamily
26:10
development. So apartments, town homes, um anything like that where we're
26:15
building that inventory, you see less students generated from this residential inventory. And as you have built more
26:23
units of that type, that yield rate has decreased. And so likely the new apartment complexes coming online um
26:30
they build more units but they're not seeing that direct number of students which means a decreasing yield rate and
26:36
a sort of limitation when we think about more apartments or more town homes being built in the
26:42
district. We also dig into this um even deeper where we look at the geography.
26:48
And so this case it's the same analysis but we show this by our elementary boundaries because where the units are
26:55
located in the district also has a um effect on the yield rate. So for the top
27:00
table our single family units you guys are seeing the greatest yield rate from our North Ridge elementary school. the
27:08
households in that neighborhood or in that boundary generate more kids than other um neighborhoods throughout the
27:15
district versus Dallas Center Elementary having a lower single family yield rate
27:20
having the lowest between our other elementary schools. Multifamily similar um but in
27:26
this case Dallas Center has the highest multifamily yield rate um and then Northridge would have the lowest
27:32
multifamily yield rate. So it gets into where are the units located, what's the price point, what's the attractability
27:39
that we are mapping out here. And so that just goes into okay,
27:44
what is the type of units in each boundary? And so in this case, the purple bars are the number of single
27:51
family units in each boundary. And then the blue is the multifamily. And so you
27:56
have a pretty similar number of single family units in each of our elementary schools. With Northridge, those 1,200
28:03
units are just generating the most amount of students. The multif family is
28:08
pretty different where you have a lot of multifamily, like in the South Prairie boundary, there's a lot of it. Um, and
28:15
there's just less units really in the Dallas center boundary, but the units that are there yield a lot of students.
28:22
And so it's that kind of relationship of newer multif family versus existing multif
28:29
family. And so to kind of wrap up that whole analysis, we have a map here which is looking at the areas in red have the
28:36
greatest student yield rate and then kind of the green to blue have the lowest student yield rate. So you can see this pocket um of where we're seeing
28:44
the greatest generation of students.
28:50
So then moving into what we also map out for our housing inventory. This visual
28:56
looks at the average year built of the areas in each planning area. And so red
29:01
areas would have the newest units built in the district after
29:07
2020. And then our median home value. So trying to isolate, you know, what's the
29:12
age, what's the condition of the inventory, as well as what's the price point, what can people afford, and where
29:17
are we seeing a greater correlation of home price to
29:24
students. And then looking at our recent year built, and so you can see these clusters of dots indicating the past
29:30
five years of residential inventory. In 2020, we built 245 units. And in 2024,
29:37
we built 60. So that's kind of that slowdown that we're looking at. But not to say that we don't have a lot of
29:43
potential on the horizon. And so um I mean you heard from Dallas Center a little bit ago. We also toured the
29:50
district and met with both cities and mapped out where they think potential growth is happening. And both cities
29:56
have kind of talked about that they think that unit activity is going to start ticking up. that kind of slowed
30:01
down with some plats finishing up, but they've had a lot of projects through that planning phase that is now opening
30:08
up for a greater um development period the next 3 to four years. And so this
30:14
map is looking at in green the areas that um we're saying are current or active that either are pulling permits
30:20
or they're about to start moving dirt um pretty soon. And then the yellow and the purple is our potential growth on more
30:28
of a 5 to 10 year timeline. And so I I always want to put, you know, a little disclaimer. You know, those
30:33
growth areas are the best known information at the time. Some things like infrastructure connectivity or
30:39
developer interest as well as um the economic variables have a change of
30:45
maybe which projects happen faster, which ones happen slower. But this gives you kind of a map out of the opportunity
30:51
of development throughout the district.
30:56
And so all the areas on the map um correlate with this table here. And so we have all of the areas labeled what
31:03
the development type is and what the timing and potential unit outlook is. And so we're looking at um over
31:11
5,800 potential units over these next 10 years. But in the current and active
31:17
stages, we're looking at about 1,400 units that we think are either building right now or about to start
31:24
building. A lot of um those potential units are in that five-year timeline, which means like they're ready to go and
31:31
it may some may happen faster, some may happen sooner. Um but we're going to continue to watch those and make sure
31:36
that we line up with infrastructure development and city code to see those five years of when they start.
31:45
So then we also just look at well what would this look like over time and so by decade by decade what has been the
31:52
growth in your district in 2010 to 2019 you saw the most units built. Right now
31:58
we're definitely under that track of becoming as well built as that decade.
32:03
Um but we think that's going to start picking up a little bit. So is it going to be 2,600 units by 2029? Probably not.
32:11
Um, but we do think that speed is going to increase a little
32:18
bit. And then our last piece here is just kind of a node to the regional and
32:24
economic spotlight. So, there's a lot of exciting projects happening in the community. Um, greater boost to the job
32:30
growth as well as just the live livability of more families moving into the district. And so, um, with positive
32:36
things like this, we tend to see greater, um, attraction into the district, which supports greater student
32:44
growth. All right. So, then moving into our student
32:50
projections, our first visual here is looking at just our accuracy over time. Um, you guys have worked with RSP for a
32:57
long time and so we're kind of tracking what does this look like over time. last year's projections, we're at the
33:04
98.9% accuracy, um, which was about 39 students over projected. So, you guys
33:10
came in a little bit under what was forecasted for last year, but still tracking very good, especially at that
33:15
middle and high school level. The next visual here is looking
33:22
at the um, projected outlook for our kindergarten versus 12th grade as well
33:27
as our total grade bands. And so that top visual is looking at what is the kindergarten class forecasted to be
33:34
versus the 12th grade class. Kind of that main rule of thumb of growth outlook. And so we do think both of
33:40
these grades are going to continue increasing the next five years. Um
33:45
kindergarten increasing up to around 285 students and then 12th grade increasing
33:51
to around 280. So, kindergarten continue to be larger for the most part than 12th
33:56
grade class, but it does get kind of closer, which makes it more challenging to see growth year after year if your
34:02
12th grade and kindergarten class are very similar in size. And then the bottom graphic is
34:08
looking at your overall grade size um comparison at these different levels. And so you can see in the past where you
34:14
used to have elementary as obviously the largest classes in the district, but as
34:20
those classes have cohorted forward, moved into middle and high school, kind of all grade levels are kind of
34:26
converging around that 280 to 290 student mark. And so more of a stability
34:33
year after year as all of your grades become
34:39
larger. All right. So then your official RSP projections here we have the
34:44
district growing by about 300 students at the elementary level. Um we have a
34:51
forecasted growth of about 140 students which is about a 10% growth rate over
34:56
these next five years. Middle school a bit more stable growth of about 50 students at about a
35:04
4% growth rate. And then our high school um similar to elementary at a growth
35:10
rate of about 10% as those grades move in and smaller grades at the high school
35:16
move
35:21
out. And so the next thing we provide um is kind of your all-in-one table where
35:27
we're mapping out all the key information from the report. And so there's a lot of information on this
35:32
slide um but we really structure it so hopefully you guys can use it. um in any kind of way. And so what you have on
35:39
this table is all of your buildings as well as the district capacity provided for those buildings. And then you have
35:45
your enrollment provided three different ways for the past. The um middle row that reside
35:53
green font is how many students physically reside in each boundary for your
35:58
elementary because we know that there's some movement of where you live versus where you go. And so reside enrollment
36:05
would be looking at total kids living in each boundary. The blue font bottom row is attend. How many students physically
36:12
attended each building. And so for example, if we look at Dallas Center Elementary, there was 171 students who
36:20
resided in that boundary. 166 students attended that building this year. And then the top
36:27
row, that purple font, is a subset of reside. So, it's saying that 156
36:33
students resided and attended, which means that there were um you know about 20 students that left that district and
36:40
then there was about 10 students from a different boundary that came in. And so that kind of movement um we're trying to
36:46
capture with this table. It also kind of gives you guys the tools to think about programming and addressing challenges in
36:52
a different way. If you're thinking about boundary adjustments or where students live, you'd be looking at that
36:58
reside number versus if it's programming changes or class size balance, you'd be
37:03
looking at that attend number. Okay? So, just a lot of information there that we try to give you. The shading that's
37:10
green is correlating with the utilization of the facility. So, when enrollment dips below 70% of the
37:17
capacity, we shaded it in green. And so there's some underutilization challenges
37:22
likely at the elementary level where we're dipping below that district capacity. But at the secondary level um
37:30
we have a very adequate capacity utilization. So um the middle school and
37:36
Oak View both utilized at about a 78% and the high school is getting pretty
37:41
tight. And so with that 10% growth rate at that high school level we're getting really near that 1,200 student capacity.
37:49
So around a 99% utilization five years
37:56
out. And then the last thing that we have provided here is your enrollment by grade. And so looking at um total grade
38:04
levels um for like elementary you would need to distribute it between the buildings. But overall looking at what
38:11
each grade band would look like by 2930. Um, we're thinking most grades are above
38:17
that 280 mark. Um, with kindergarten coming in closer to 290 and some of our
38:23
larger grades hitting above a 320
38:30
mark. So then this goes through kind of the final conclusions here with that uptick of housing and greater in
38:36
migration and cohort growth. That's where we're really leaning on this greater traction to build up more
38:42
students as that growth rate ticks up. the next couple of
38:47
years. And so next steps for you all to consider, we always leave with some different thoughts and some different
38:54
things that we want you guys to look for. And so definitely, you know, monitoring the demographic trend. So
39:00
that live birth rate data that that's a new thing that we're really wanting to analyze each year as well as ESA or
39:07
other state policy changes um could impact the enrollment outlook.
39:14
And so next steps for you all, I mean we always encourage analyzing enrollment each year and then those different
39:20
challenges of underutilization at some elementary as well as um looking at a
39:26
potential high school addition to increase the capacity and provide more capacity space there. And so with that,
39:34
um what questions do you guys have? How how can I help you guys kind of use this as a tool to make some different
39:40
decisions?
39:46
Um, maybe just a a quick question and I don't know if you have a slide here that that shows it. You kind of showed the
39:53
accuracy slide. I don't know, it's probably back a dozen slides or go or so. You've been our demographer for a
39:59
long time and I think for a long time your your projections were, you know, within a percentage of a or a fraction
40:05
of a percent and and we could really, you know, plan for those things. But if we were to go back and look at like 20
40:11
and 21, my recollection was that I don't think we
40:16
forecasted at least from RSP that we were going to hit consecutive years of negative
40:22
enrollment. So is that is that a fair statement that I think we always were showing a projection of positive
40:28
enrollment. It slowed, but I don't remember it going negative. And when we pull for just K12 too for students in
40:36
your building, that official count didn't decrease either. And so with some of your other pockets that don't fit
40:42
that official count enrollment, um that was more of the decrease experienced because if I go back to full K12 of
40:49
those buildings, we do have um growth happening. So when you say the other pockets, what
40:55
are those? Is that open enrollment or is it something else? Um, it would be looking at maybe like
41:01
your preschool numbers or some of those things that are outside our forecast. Okay.
41:11
So, was that right? 300 students in five years. That what was that that forecast was for? Mhm.
41:17
Just doing a quick math ahead. seems like that might be like if all those developments do come online and using
41:23
the formula that you gave like that that sounds like it might be under that just
41:28
me quick math in my head with 600 units over in Dallas center if those are all done in five years
41:36
not all of them but it's it's 59 right 59% or that's per 100 houses is 59 kids
41:41
right so if you use that math that'd be 240 kids just right there
41:47
which that is so when we look at like the current units that is most of those current activity and so those units
41:54
coming in um really leans to that. And the other thing of looking at um if your
42:00
total yield rate is that kind of 60 students per 100 units that's that's including all of your current and
42:06
residential inventory that has had kids for a long time. We do see some differing fluctuations in new builds. Um
42:14
and so we would even map out in our modeling a more accurate uh future residential yield rate when we look at
42:20
what is this building type versus other building types that have built um you know the same number of bedrooms, the
42:26
same price point and we get more granular with these endall projections.
42:36
you noted the live birth rate and how are you looking at that now compared to
42:41
how you were looking at that five years ago or more? Yeah. Um we're definitely
42:47
seeing a decreasing live birth rate in most areas and most of the school districts that we work with and that has
42:53
been a limitation to that kindergarten enrollment. I think most of our districts either um their kindergarten
42:59
class came in lower or at least came in a little underprotected. You guys are actually kind of an outlier with your
43:06
increase of the kindergarten class this year. Um so it is something that we're monitoring even closer because it does
43:12
seem to be a greater limitation to that kindergarten roundup.
43:17
Yeah. And can we talk about that a minute? Because I think I mean I I don't see a glide path for kindergarten
43:24
enrollment to match 12th grade enrollment, particularly as we get toward our freshman class moving toward
43:32
senior year. That class is in excess of 300. I think if we look at our seventh and eighth grade classes, maybe even
43:38
down to fifth and sixth grade, it it I don't see those those two things
43:43
matching anytime soon as of the number of kids. Yeah. The kindergarten class being anywhere near
43:49
the size of our senior class because I think that was a little bit sorry of
43:55
what you were talking about was those two things needed to be um well the the the kindergarten class
44:01
needed to be larger than the 12th grade class to you know, maybe as as an indication that um positive enrollment
44:09
was going to be sustainable. It is a good kind of rule of thumb, but you have to also layer in the rest. So,
44:15
also like the cohort change and the number of kids we think are coming in from the new housing. Um but like this
44:21
visual when we just compared that kindergarten to 12th grade class you'll see that in 27 28 we think 12th grade
44:28
class is larger and so that is kind of a limitation likely that nth grade class
44:33
moving forward. Um there are some big pockets that um it's not completely
44:39
where we think every year kindergarten comes in higher. Um, but you can see it's kind of just
44:44
this trend where in the past your kindergarten class was historically much larger than your 12th grade class, but
44:51
it's becoming a lot closer and closer, which means that you are contingent on those other variables like housing
44:57
development and cohort change to see greater growth. Yeah. which also kind of
45:04
speaks to your point of a little bit more of a limited model because we're also factoring in those limitations of a
45:10
larger 12th grade class and more of a stable kindergarten. Well, I guess they will be lower. I mean, we have an
45:16
abnormally small 11th grade class. If you look at how it's bookended, I mean,
45:21
the both the senior class this year and the current 10th graders are much larger and I think projected to be much larger
45:28
than the incoming kindergarten class for those years. Most likely, yes. And there is some that little cohort change where
45:35
we do see some decreasing of enrollment once you get into 11th and 12th. And so that's factored in those big grades, but
45:42
they are still larger than what the 12th grade class was when they were in nth grade.
45:54
when it comes to the building usage um slide um and we were talking about or
46:02
you were talking about um here so like underutilization of buildings but then
46:07
how that uh coincides with the momentum of these fluctuating numbers and classes
46:14
um I I guess this is like a question for later, but if we have underutilized
46:21
buildings, but also buildings sneaking up on capacity. Um maybe there's some
46:27
creative moving around. Is that something that you see in work that you do with districts? Like Absolutely. Hey,
46:33
we've got some space over here. Let's Mhm. Um but I guess that would have to
46:38
come into to longer term trends then, right? Like I don't know. Sorry, I'm
46:43
thinking out loud. and rubber ducking term from uh my husband. That is
46:49
something we absolutely do. So, if it's a balance between like the attendance of where the boundaries are at versus maybe
46:56
it's something like moving a program to increase enrollment at a certain facility, we come alongside um school
47:02
districts all over the area to help them with that and balancing between buildings utilization wise and also
47:08
class size-wise. Okay. Yeah. Wonderful. Thank you. Do you guys track in like previous years
47:14
when you show and build out your current your fivey year and 10 year growth projection? I guess from a development
47:20
standpoint. So if you go back to 2021, do you know like as a percentage of our projection how much we hit on those
47:26
projected future developments? Meaning we can project five years. let's say
47:32
only half came online or do you guys track kind of like where the variance or delta would be between where we
47:38
projected you know the growth to be and kind of what's that delta or variance look like? That's definitely something I
47:44
could track down. I don't have it in the slide deck at that narrow of a level. Um but I could get that for you of what we
47:50
thought a growth area was and what year it would track with students and then what was reality. Yeah, because I'm
47:55
guessing probably most districts are kind of seeing the stalling out a little bit. There's probably little pockets in
48:01
Walke but most people I guess because this is very contingent upon developers taking chances on things which obviously
48:08
are outside of what you can predict, right? Yes. Exactly. And there's a lot of things that we are just kind of
48:13
seeing like nationwide and statewide with a slowdown and some things that are completely outside of even like your
48:19
little portal of building activity and the supply chain that are kind of limitations to that speed of growth.
48:32
Any other questions?
48:42
Well, thank you. RSP's been a great Did you have a question? Yeah, RSP has been a great partner to us
48:48
for a long time. We appreciate your demography work and it's always been very helpful to us in planning. So,
48:54
thank you for coming. Absolutely. Thank you guys for having me. Thanks for Absolutely.
49:02
All right.
49:11
All right. This is the one agenda item that I loathe reading every year. So, I'm gonna
49:18
let you read this one, Bloom. As fun as it would be to hear you brag about yourself. Yeah, this is great. And
49:25
shockingly off off cuff, um we do get to celebrate um you know, schoolboard month
49:32
and I just publicly on behalf of DCG staff members, families. It's, you know,
49:38
and in a lot of ways I I think people potentially may not appreciate the time
49:44
that goes in there. There's kind of a lot of behind thescenes work. It's a lot more than a couple hour meetings on a
49:51
Monday night that you are all a part of all on behalf of taking care of the entire district, family, friends at a
49:58
whopping zero dollars a month. Um, so I just want to say thank you. It's been a
50:04
pleasure last couple years working with you. Um, it's fun to be superintendent and dad hat and just know your hearts
50:11
for kids and staff and always asking the right questions to keep DCG as a whole
50:16
on the forefront. So, just appreciate all of you. Um, you have a fun little certificate and a pie that if anyone
50:24
sticks around that's here, they are required to offer you. So I just that is
50:31
that is new new benefit really going off cuff with now just making up a rule. So
50:38
um thank you thank you everyone for your commitment.
50:46
Well thank you very much. Uh moving along to reports. Any questions on the written
50:54
reports? Okay we'll move along to the building level reports. Um, Miss Cummings and Miss Olsen.
51:07
We got a whole crew with us. So, that's great. You get a two for one. Yeah. In one.
51:18
All right. They're moving on up. That's right. Good evening, everyone, and and happy
51:24
board appreciation month. We certainly appreciate all of you. Um Shana and I
51:29
were offered the opportunity to present in two different months and we said, "No, wait a minute. The school
51:35
improvement team, teaching and learning and student services is very collaborative. We work together very
51:41
well and have since day one." And we said we'd really like to do the same night. And we heard there was an award
51:47
for bringing the most presenters in one uh in one evening. So we win. We win. But seriously, our goal
51:55
on the school improvement team is to work alongside the DCG staff to provide
52:01
excellent services to our students here, not only through core instruction, but
52:07
also specialized services and supports to our diverse learners. And we have all of our areas represented this evening.
52:13
And we believe you'll be impressed by what they have to share.
52:21
Excuse me. Nothing. All right. Um, so we decided to really focus on professional
52:26
learning this year, uh, or at our presentation today because that's been a huge part of what we've been doing this
52:32
year with our added Wednesday afternoons. Um, we've had many opportunities to provide additional
52:37
professional learning. Um, and trust me, it is not Greg Rocks and I doing all the professional learning. And that's part
52:43
of why we wanted to highlight these folks because they really have come alongside us, partnered with us, and led
52:49
the way in the professional learning that we've been able to do for so many groups this year, which has been a a
52:56
really exciting shift for us. We feel like we've been able to reach more groups of people um this year than we
53:02
were able to in the year previous that we were both here. Anyway, so um we are going to just this is kind of our our
53:09
little agenda here. So from the teaching and learning side, we're going to talk about what our district learning has looked like. Um that has really been
53:15
facilitated by Dr. Corenza. Um but then carried out by our instructional coaches and our principles at the building
53:22
level. Um and then each building has taken their own um their own path on building level. So we have an elementary
53:28
and a secondary representative here. Um then our curriculum facilitators are going to talk about the learning that
53:33
comes with implementing the curricula curriculum review cycle. and then I'll give you just a little snapshot on our
53:38
content um specific and then if you want to talk a bit about student services. You bet. Our elementary special
53:45
education teachers have um really uh led developed and led their own professional
53:50
development this year. And I'll let uh Jenny and Emily talk about that. and our
53:56
secondary special educators have focused on IDA, that individuals with
54:01
disabilities education act, learning more about transition planning and getting our secondary learners ready for
54:08
the the world of living, learning, and working beyond high school. And then our fabulous English language learner
54:14
department um will share what they've done in terms of their own professional learning as well as outreach to staff.
54:21
TAG is not represented tonight under student services, but you heard from them at an earlier board meeting and the
54:27
tremendous work they're doing this year, not only again with their own professional development, but developing
54:33
general educators they work with and um also their uh program review that they've kicked off this year. So, um TAG
54:41
is with us here in spirit and we're here physically at an earlier meeting. Awesome. Just quick introductions of the
54:48
teaching and learning team. if you'll give a little wave when I call your name. So, um Jim Shut, and Kelsey
54:53
Stratton are going to present on the district um professional development.
54:58
Abby Crannle, Julie Morgan, and Lindseay Casper are going to give a little overview of their building level um
55:04
professional development. And then Ashton Rees and Jessica Sookup are going to talk about the curriculum review cycle. So, we're going to go ahead and
55:11
get started with our district level learning.
55:20
Good evening. I have the privilege of talking about um our professional development from this year at the
55:26
district level which was around the strong framework and this year our district has been focused on building a
55:31
shared understanding of the strong instructional framework. So our long range goal is that by the end of 2029,
55:38
100% of our staff will use this framework to set goals and engage in meaningful feedback about their work. So
55:46
to get there, our short-term goal is that by the end of this year, everyone has been introduced to the six strong
55:53
standards as outlined in our 2425 PD calendar. So we might be asking, well,
55:59
why strong? I know a lot of our staff was at the beginning of the year. and it gives us a common language. It gives
56:06
clear expectations and a framework that supports continuous growth and it is truly a performance evaluation system,
56:12
but that's down the road. So, we didn't want to overwhelm staff with the fact that yes, this will eventually be the
56:18
way that we are all evaluated right now. We just really wanted to introduce them to those six standards, but it is a
56:24
system that can evaluate teachers, educational specialists, principles, district leaders, superintendents, Dr.
56:30
Bloom uh classified staff and pair of professionals. So to make sure that we
56:36
rolled it out in a consistent and thoughtful way, principles, coaches, and district leaders collaborated to design
56:42
PD. I loved um Dr. Kenza's. He would we would all meet together and he would
56:47
already have the bones of the of the PD and the the Google slides that we were working from. He always had really great
56:53
little animations and that was my favorite part. um not my only favorite
56:59
part, but we also used other strategies. There was some real learning happening. We um we would go back then to our
57:05
buildings after we all got together and we would do some jigsaw reading, explore the standards. Um we had, you know, we
57:12
know that feedback loops are really important. So there's an FAQ um for frequently asked questions that we would
57:18
all meet and talk about after that PD for the FAQ document. We took time to unpack each standard and really learn
57:25
about the related indicators which Jim is going to talk about here.
57:31
So um there are six standards that we have in the strong instructional framework and that's professional
57:37
knowledge, instructional planning, instructional delivery, assessment, learning environment and
57:42
professionalism. And so each one of these standards includes specific indicators or kind of look fors that
57:48
helps us understand and identify high quality instruction. For example, like under instructional planning, we look at
57:55
how instruction is focused, how time is optimized, whether learning objectives are clear, how student data is used to
58:03
inform planning. And then we go on to instructional delivery, which the
58:08
indicators show things like a variety of instructional strategies, differentiating instruction, setting
58:15
high expectations, and promoting higher order thinking. Our district-wide learning this year has laid a strong
58:21
foundation of using this framework to support teaching and learning. It provides a clear path forward for us so
58:29
that we can plan, deliver, and reflect on instruction in a way that ensures all students have access to high quality
58:36
teaching every
58:44
day. Good evening. Um, my name is Abby Krenel and I'm an instructional coach at Heritage Elementary. So, um, just as Jim
58:52
and Kelsey described that, uh, the teachers engaged at district level PD within the building, um, each building
58:59
also had their own, um, building level professional development. So, I'm going to give you just a brief overview of
59:06
what that looked like at Heritage this year. So, you can see that we have a long-term goal of May 2029. um 100% of
59:14
our students will be either proficient or advanced on the uh literacy ISASP and
59:21
then um to get there one stepping stone was that by this May um 80% of our
59:27
student groups would be um proficient in the literacy fast spring benchmark and
59:34
by student groups you can see some examples there would be uh our EL students special education by gender and
59:41
so on that data is still rolling in. So I don't have final numbers on that but it's looking very very good. Um so what
59:49
we decided to do based on that um from teacher voice within the building at Heritage is they wanted to engage in um
59:55
personalized professional development shortened up to PPD. Um and so each
1:00:01
teacher was um allowed to um given the opportunity to based on uh trend data at
1:00:07
Heritage, student data, and then their own professional uh judgment of where they needed to um improve
1:00:13
professionally, they were um asked to select a topic or a goal to um engage in
1:00:21
professional development. And so just some sample topics at Heritage were uh a
1:00:26
lot of teachers wanted to increase the student engagement during spec excuse me specifically literacy instruction and
1:00:33
then increase the reading proficiency for English learners supporting and educating uh traumatized students and
1:00:40
then play-based learning and early childhood. That is not an exhaustive list just a few that I chose to sample.
1:00:47
So you can see uh the graphic there shows the uh development um model that
1:00:53
we engaged in. So we would collect data, we would um implement best practice in
1:00:59
literacy strategies for student engagement or whatever the topic was. Um they would partner with each other,
1:01:05
partner with me as a coach, uh reflect, um implement, collect data again. And then
1:01:13
that cycle just continued on and on and on throughout the year um which was amazing. And then um so the the building
1:01:20
time was spent with them uh engaging in that cycle. And then just one piece of sample data collected here was that in
1:01:27
our kindergarten um overall one of our kindergarten classrooms started the year with uh student engagement during
1:01:33
phonics instruction specifically. So in November, 75% of that particular
1:01:39
kindergarten classroom, the students were actively engaged. Um that doesn't mean just complying, but like actively
1:01:46
engaging with the learning. And then by May, 95% of those same students were
1:01:51
actively engaged, which then um obviously leads to uh greater student
1:01:56
achievement. So that was our academic goal. And then um at heritage we also um
1:02:02
were noticing that we needed to strengthen our building um culture and climate and uh based on some surveys
1:02:10
that we have given um we decided to uh undertake a book study um the power of a
1:02:17
positive team by John Gordon. And so in order to do that it wasn't just um principal Diane Williamson or myself
1:02:23
leading that. We um blended seven different teams throughout the building and they planned and facilitated
1:02:31
um different portions of that book with the staff. Um that was amazing to see
1:02:36
that shared leadership and was very powerful. And then um we also based on that survey uh decided we needed to um
1:02:44
engage in some learning walks um with the intent of focusing on learning from
1:02:49
one another with uh centered around those student engagement strategies um to build trust and learn from one
1:02:56
another. And so far the feedback on the learning walks was very positive. And so
1:03:01
we plan to continue those next year as well.
1:03:11
Good evening. Uh we're going to share about professional learning at the high school this year. We also had um three
1:03:19
goals, an academic goal, an attendance goal, and a climate c culture goal. Um Lindsay and I are going to focus on the
1:03:25
academic goal that we had this year. Um so last spring, as part of the school
1:03:30
improvement process, we created these two goals that aligned with our district goals. Um so for this year our goal was
1:03:38
to have 100% of our high school teaching staff to address an academic challenge
1:03:43
by integrating at least two new researchbased best practices in their instruction following um professional
1:03:50
development. So they gave us a number of different academic challenges. Um BLT
1:03:56
took um their feedback and narrowed it down to these kind of big four categories. We had student engagement,
1:04:03
differentiation, formative assessments, and quality of work. And so, um, with
1:04:08
BLT, they, um, asked if we would do more of like a personalized PD approach just
1:04:15
like heritage. Um, they also wanted some crosscurricular collaboration or opportunities to do that. So, we wanted
1:04:21
to make sure that we, um, did that this year. Uh because we had the district PD
1:04:27
calendar well in advance, we were able to kind of chunk our goal into bite-sized pieces for each term. So the
1:04:33
first term we had learning around all academic challenge areas here and then
1:04:39
teachers were able to choose one area based on the students that they had in front of them. And then they were able
1:04:45
to choose a research um based strategy, integrate it into their classroom,
1:04:50
collect data, reflect on it, collaborate with others. And then they did that again term three and then Lindsay is
1:04:56
going to share what we did are doing right now term four.
1:05:01
So we have a well all of our work is really grounded in research and so we used John Hattie as our kind of baseline
1:05:08
of looking at what are the biggest influences that can hit student learning and anything above that point four is
1:05:15
kind of where we wanted to stay with our teachers. So we in the term one we did a
1:05:20
lot of learning around those different things and they kind of got to choose what one they won or a couple that they really wanted to utilize in their
1:05:27
strategy. Um and so then go to the next slide. We have a couple examples of our
1:05:32
teachers. So we're going to be doing this Wednesday and next Wednesday a strategy symposium where they have
1:05:38
gotten together and they kind of have this template. All of them have a similar template where they get to share their strategy from term two that they
1:05:45
focused on. And you can see the strategy details and recommendations are really what did they do that worked well? What
1:05:52
um recommendations would they give to another teacher if they were to try this in their classroom. Um you can see on
1:05:57
the bottom the research part those are the John Hattie influences on learning. So for Missky's here, she utilized
1:06:04
scaffolding which has a 82 effect size. Um, and then the p the thumbs up and
1:06:09
thumbs down were just kind of quick little here's what went really well, here's what didn't based off of student
1:06:15
feedback, teacher feedback, and then effectiveness rating. Um, I think we did out of five, wasn't it? Um, what would
1:06:22
you rate it and then why? And so this will hopefully give teachers that quick little collaboration, seeing, oh, I can
1:06:28
take that and use it in my classroom. And then there's a couple other ones I g um this is Jake Lewis in the wait room.
1:06:35
So, he wanted to really empower his students into utilizing their own data and collecting their data to inform kind
1:06:41
of what they were going to do with it. Um, and you can kind of see the data in the middle and No, you're good. No,
1:06:47
you're good. And then, um, Castle is one of our vocal music teachers and she wanted to be really intentional with
1:06:53
where she placed practice throughout class. And so, she collect a lot of data on it. You can see three out of five um,
1:07:00
there. But the other thing that these have done really well for us as coaches is they're trying something and it's
1:07:06
automatically increasing our enrollment in our um coaching because they're coming in and saying, "I want to do
1:07:11
this. I don't know how. Can we walk through it?" And we do either do modeling, data collection, that type of stuff. And there's one last one. Um,
1:07:20
April Bush, one of our art teachers, she was really focusing on how to model some different techniques with students, but
1:07:25
making sure to do it in a way where kids will really elaborate with their creativity and push it a little bit
1:07:31
further. Um, so yeah, on Wednesday, we'll have 70ish teachers have these out
1:07:36
and we're going to do a little roundroin and get some more of that collaboration and be able to look at each other as
1:07:41
experts and peers to learn from. So that's it. Thank you.
1:07:51
Um so at DCG we follow a seven-year curriculum review cycle and that's kind of what um the curriculum facilitators
1:07:57
Ashton and myself and then Tyra Beckondorf and Adam Churchma that's what we center our work on in the areas that
1:08:03
we support. Um and this is designed to ensure that each content area receives thoughtful intentional attention over
1:08:09
time. Um each year is dedicated to a specific phase from evaluation of the
1:08:15
content area of the program through uh program revision, resource studies, material studies, implementation, and
1:08:22
then just kind of monitoring where they're at through years 5 through 7. Um this allows us to keep curriculum
1:08:29
aligned with standards um grounded in research and be responsive to student needs as well. So making sure that we're
1:08:34
looking at student data. Uh this year the curriculum facilitators have also
1:08:40
been spending a lot of time with um Shana in focusing on this whole process
1:08:46
in general and just really honing in on each year and what happens in each year for the different content areas. That
1:08:52
way we're just setting ourselves up for success in the future. And the biggest thing we wanted to highlight like for
1:08:59
looking at year two, so I support uh specifically music, science, and world language. And then Jessica supports math
1:09:07
and K12 art teachers and K6 school counselors. Yes. Um so we were in uh
1:09:13
highlighting year two for math and music. Um specifically a lot of people in the community are wondering what
1:09:19
we're doing on our flex days. Well flex days have given our team flexibility in shaping the curriculum review cycle to
1:09:25
meet the needs of the content teams we're working with and for the cycle year they're on. for content areas like
1:09:32
math. This gave like Jessica and Shana time to collaborate with Barb Searsland with the A.E.A. to set up their
1:09:39
professional development talking about trends, standards, and everything else with content. And this is also for our
1:09:45
other core areas for music, which is what I supported. The team had the opportunity um to engage in professional
1:09:54
learning virtually with Dr. Hoffman from Belmont University. Um so in the various
1:10:00
districts um I know Nancy works in Johnston uh with music students they may be learning how to count like one and
1:10:06
two and in uh Dallas Center Grimes we have adopted Tacademi for our counting
1:10:12
system so all of our K12 teachers received professional learning and each
1:10:17
session we had three of them he um added a tier and a layer so they're all speaking the same language. Um last year
1:10:25
our instrumental team on those flex days were able to participate in a program
1:10:30
review with Paul Brrizzy out of Ankenany and he came in and was able to work with the teachers and we're actually adopting
1:10:37
um a program exit survey for students that choose to leave the band program
1:10:42
that we can identify trends and try to improve retention. So that will be implemented next year. And then our KS
1:10:49
general music team has been able to look towards year three next year with moving towards a guaranteed and viable
1:10:56
curriculum across the district because right now it's more of like silos what we are seeing with ELA. So we are now
1:11:03
moving in the direction with music on having an adopted curriculum. And the biggest accomplishment this year was the
1:11:09
K12 music department was able to collectively write a unified core belief
1:11:15
statement which is the Dallas Center Grimes music department is dedicated to
1:11:20
empowering student musicians by providing a safe and encouraging environment that nurtures music literacy
1:11:27
and personal growth. We strive to inspire a lasting passion for music,
1:11:32
build community connections, and equip students to create and share meaningful musical
1:11:38
experiences. So, as Ashton said, this was kind of part of the year 2 work for both math and music. We're at year two
1:11:45
and the 24 25 school year. Um, so the whole purpose of creating that core belief statement is to just kind of um
1:11:53
something that teams can continuously come back to as we get ready in year three and year four to look at other
1:11:59
curricular resources, adopt a whether we're um updating to a new version of
1:12:04
what we already have or adopting a new resource. This is just a statement that we can continuously come back to and tie
1:12:11
that work into. Um, and it got brought up at a math meeting wanting to make sure that this core belief statement
1:12:18
ties directly to whatever comes from strategic planning and the district mission and vision. And we believe that
1:12:24
it really does. And if it didn't, we would have bigger issues. But, um, so for math, we were just really wanting to
1:12:30
make sure focusing on all students, engaging them in meaningful, relevant, and rigorous learning.
1:12:40
Last thing from teaching and learning is just a quick um spotlight on we did implement two new resources in our K uh
1:12:46
K6 um ELA classroom. So for our K2 teachers, they learned about and
1:12:52
implemented UFly which is focused on foundational skills. Um, so be at the end of last school year, Tyra Bankorf
1:12:59
and I provided professional learning, a full day of professional learning for our K2 teachers. Um, and then have
1:13:05
worked with coaches to provide some additional learning throughout the year. Um, and then for three through sixth
1:13:10
grade teachers, that that was the my view is 35 and then sixth grade has my perspectives. So we worked with that
1:13:17
company to provide professional learning. We didn't have the background knowledge on this to provide it
1:13:22
ourselves. So that was part of our purchase was ongoing professional development for them and that's something that's been really valuable
1:13:28
for our teachers to feel confident in providing that instruction this year. So we'll move on to student services now to
1:13:35
keep clicking. Sure. Sure. Okay. Thank you instructional coaches and
1:13:41
facilitators, curriculum facilitators and Shana. Um uh we'll now move on to student services and I'll introduce the
1:13:48
rock stars who not yet Jenny not yet. the the the rock stars um from student
1:13:55
services, special education, and EEL who are representing um their colleagues in their buildings as well. Um, if you
1:14:01
could give a wave. We have uh Kendra Spolstra in the back there. And Kendra will be representing grades 5 through 12
1:14:08
special educators who, as I said earlier, have focused this entire year on uh honing their skills on doing a
1:14:15
better job around the IEP table of planning transitions for our students from school to the world of world of
1:14:22
living, learning, and working. So, thank you, Kendra. For elementary special education, we have Jenny Rants here from
1:14:28
Heritage and Emily, I'm sorry, Jenny from South Prairie and Emily Dre from Heritage. And um in in elementary
1:14:36
elementary K through four special education, they focused on um continuing their case study work to focus on um
1:14:44
individual case studies. They'll share more about that as well as team learning time. And we have Mary Hudson and Kayla
1:14:53
Holland here representing English language learner education. And they'll share with you about their own personal
1:14:59
growth this year through PD as well as their outreach to their general education colleagues. Very proud to have
1:15:06
them here tonight. Go ahead ladies. Okay. Um
1:15:12
Oh, I'm sorry. Kendra. Kendra. That is not Kendra Spolstra. This is Kendra
1:15:17
Spra. No, you were very you were very ready. Very ready. Okay. Um, so my name is Kendra Spzra and I am one of the six
1:15:24
special education teachers at Oak View. Um, this year I've been able to participate in many of our transition
1:15:29
trainings. Um, along with my fellow middle school and high school special education teachers. Um, so we've done a
1:15:35
5 through 12 counselors as well as our AA staff. Um, so these sessions have been enlightening and informative to say
1:15:41
the least. um they've truly changed the way that I and many of my colleagues um approach our transition IEPs and how
1:15:47
best to prepare those students um for their lives and careers after high school. So, by the time our students turn 14, um all students on their IEP um
1:15:56
we must have gathered information and have goals written to support them in their reaching um those goals that they
1:16:02
have in those areas of living, learning, and working. Um, so thanks to our training, we now have multiple resources
1:16:07
available to help us use um and gather that information um and assess where our students are at right now and then also
1:16:14
make sure that we're working with parents and teachers um and understanding how um their goals for
1:16:19
themselves can help our whole IEP team best support them. Um, so while we're
1:16:25
aware that those goals um and dreams that students may have for themselves at age 14 will not be the same things that
1:16:30
they may have for themselves um at age 18, we just want to make sure that we get those written down and start really
1:16:36
selecting areas um to help them make those dreams a reality. Um so once these students reach that transition age, we
1:16:43
continue to support them in closing the gap between themselves and peers, but also making sure that we set them up for success after high school. So a lot of
1:16:49
these supports can come in various forms. um some students may need more support than others um as these are all
1:16:55
unique and specific to each individual student. Some of these supports um could be really looking closely at their goals
1:17:01
and working with the high school counselors to think about um high school or dual credit courses that will really
1:17:06
support them um to get the most out of their high school experience. It could also be writing those specific IEP goals
1:17:12
that are tied directly to one of those transition areas of living, learning, and working. Um so one of the supports
1:17:17
that we were able to learn about more extensively was a vocational rehabilitation services. It should be
1:17:23
next slide. Um Mrs. Zambusa um our DCG rail vegetation counselor. Um she
1:17:29
provided us with a lot of information about that process um and about what services she's able to provide. So, for
1:17:35
the first time um in my 17 years of teaching, I was able to connect with her and already have a student set up um
1:17:41
with a plan um to help them with career exploration, employability, skill development, and further opportunities
1:17:48
and assessments with like job applications, resumes, and interviews once they turn 14. Um all of our special
1:17:54
education teachers were excited to hear her presentation and to continue our growth and involvement with her um to
1:18:00
help our students continue to better prepare themselves for life after high school. Um, so these trainings have been
1:18:05
invaluable and will continue to improve the way that we look at our transition IEPs, um, transition age students and
1:18:11
talk to them, um, and the whole IEP team, um, about their hopes and dreams and careers after Dela Center Grimes.
1:18:26
Okay. elementary special education teachers had an opportunity to get
1:18:31
together this year and work on case studies. So, we each came with a student
1:18:37
to our meetings and this is what we looked at. We kind of took our student and um dove a little bit deeper into
1:18:43
what they needed. We looked at their strengths and interests. We looked at their goals, services, accommodations,
1:18:49
modifications, things that were already in place. We took a look at successes that were already happening with them
1:18:55
and strategies we could use or have used with them. But ultimately what we looked at was what concern did we have as we
1:19:02
tried to move them to the next level. Um so this kind of where the magic takes place. We have a lot of special
1:19:08
education teachers. We don't get to see each other very often. So having the opportunity to share um we have teachers
1:19:15
that are excel in academics and some in behavioral needs and some with students with significant disabilities. So being
1:19:21
able just to pick each other's brains and figure out how are we going to help our students get to the next level. And
1:19:28
we did that by as we talked then we would look at what is the outcome for our student. What do we want for them?
1:19:35
What is the support we need to get to that level and then when we left our meetings we had that next step. What
1:19:42
were we going to do to help our student be um be able to grow and make some
1:19:48
progress? So that was part of our inservices. Yeah. And then our the second part of our Wednesday flex days,
1:19:55
uh we got together as all elementary sped teachers. And um the first one was
1:20:01
at South Prairie. And so they c we all came together and each school got to
1:20:06
choose what they wanted um to to present on. And u maybe it's a topic or a
1:20:13
strategy that they felt like, oh, this is really successful with a lot of our students with IEPs. And so at South
1:20:19
Prairie they talked about utilizing chat GPT um in a safe way of course to um
1:20:26
maybe write some social stories. And so if you had a student who needed a social
1:20:31
story for how to walk in the hallway, you could type that into chat GPT and then it would come up with a social
1:20:37
story. Then you could also um take pictures of your student actually um use
1:20:43
utilizing that behavior uh in an appropriate way in the hallway um and make a social story. Um, and then we had
1:20:51
our learning at Dallas Center Elementary and those teachers um just kind of
1:20:56
walked us through their classroom, their special education classroom and how they have it organized and set up so that um
1:21:03
no time is wasted in our special specially designed instruction when the students come into our classroom. Um and
1:21:10
then at Northridge um we had the special education/general education check-in.
1:21:17
And so on our Wednesday early outs, there was a time where um I know that I
1:21:22
met with some general education teachers each month and um I would send them a
1:21:28
survey um provided by Northridge. They shared this with us that um we could
1:21:34
have them fill out before Wednesday so that it could guide our conversation of how to collaborate together um to best
1:21:40
meet the needs of the students. And then at Heritage um like Abby was sharing um
1:21:48
about the power of a positive team, we um as special education teachers, we met
1:21:54
once a month with our associates and we walked through this book with them as well so that they could also have the
1:22:01
same learning because they're also a part of our building and our climate and culture. And then we also talked about
1:22:07
schedules. And so in special education there's a lot of scheduling pieces uh
1:22:14
with associates and with ourselves. And so just um how does that work and how
1:22:19
can we um implement it with fidelity? Thank you. Thank you ladies.
1:22:29
Kayla and Mary. All right. Hi everyone. Um, I'd like to
1:22:34
start off by thanking the AA for providing us the opportunity to do two different book studies. So, the first
1:22:40
one we did was literacy foundations for English learners during our EL flex day
1:22:45
PDS and then the second one was meeting the needs of Slife during an asynchronous style learning. Um, many
1:22:52
students come to us with diff diverse backgrounds that impact their learning. Factors like socioeconomic status,
1:22:58
trauma or limited early literacy can create educational gap gaps. To support them, we must meet students where they
1:23:04
are, not where we expect them to be. Um, for English learners, language development happens in stages.
1:23:11
Listening, speaking, reading and writing. It involves phenology, sematics, morphology, syntax, and
1:23:17
pragmatics. Understanding these helps us scaffold learning and respond with patience. Core literacy skills like
1:23:24
phenemic awareness, phonics, fluency and vocabulary must be explicitly taught
1:23:29
especially for those with inconsistent instruction. And then for life students also those with limited or interrupted
1:23:36
formal education often need support beyond ESL. They may lack basic literacy
1:23:42
but bring resilience and life experience. Our instruction must honor that and help them build both academic
1:23:49
and real world skills. These this work matters. By understanding these
1:23:54
concepts, we create more inclusive, effective classrooms and support every student's growth both academically and
1:24:00
emotionally. All right. Hi everyone. I'm Mary Hudson.
1:24:06
I'm the EL program facilitator and a proud teacher at the middle school and DCE. Um, we had the unique experience of
1:24:14
reaching out to our different schools to see who had room even though the
1:24:19
calendar was already made. So, I was just trying to insert myself in there. Um, who would want to do extra
1:24:25
professional development focused on best practices for our English language learners, especially and including
1:24:32
newcomers and slice students who would be students with uh limited or interrupted formal education, which we
1:24:38
do have quite a few of. Um, we were able to facilitate PD at South Prairie a
1:24:44
couple times, um, high school once and Oakview as well. Um, we really heard
1:24:51
from a lot of our educators that they wanted more understanding on how to
1:24:56
integrate scaffolding into all curricular areas. So, we were able to focus on practical strategies like
1:25:03
scaffolding in instruction using visuals and sentence frames and incorporating
1:25:08
academic language across all areas. And we aligned our supports with the ELPA standards, which is that big uh English
1:25:15
language learning test that we just got the scores back today. and they are looking so good made my whole Monday. Um, we were
1:25:23
also able to look at differentiated instruction based on the actual student population that we have in front of us.
1:25:30
Um, we also provided teachers with hands-on tools and modeling to help integrate language support into daily
1:25:37
lessons. Um, we were able to use school AI as an example. They have a wonderful
1:25:43
um lesson planning AI tool that can help integrate English language learning
1:25:49
scaffolding in every single ELPA level. Super fun to check out. We were able to demonstrate this, practice it together,
1:25:55
and get in the-moment feedback both at Oakview and the high school. And we saw wonderful growth in all educators who
1:26:01
were receiving this. We truly believe that um it is every single educator's
1:26:06
purpose and duty to teach all of our English language learners English, both academically and socially, not just ESL
1:26:13
teachers, because we all touch their lives at some point during the day. We're really excited that we've already
1:26:19
seen positive changes in classroom engagement and language acquisition, and I'm very excited to see what we will do
1:26:25
next year. Thank you so much. All right, just wrapping things up for
1:26:31
both of our departments. Um, our big focus is on collaboration. Rox and I have had the ability to do that. Um,
1:26:37
really since we started here together. Um, and now I'm we will be moving on
1:26:42
from each other. We're not crying. I promise. Um, I didn't expect it. Um, but
1:26:48
really have some goals. Um, you know, we've set some goals for what the work will look like next year. um and really
1:26:53
focusing on collaboration, ensuring we have materials and resources across all of these programs that we talked about.
1:26:59
Um so just kind of bringing all of those areas up to speed. Very good. I think you've said it all, Director Olsen. We
1:27:06
just like to punctuate that uh if there was ever any doubt, and I don't think there would be in this group of the
1:27:12
tremendous value of professional learning and our early dismissals. Wow. These 12 individuals have showcased that
1:27:18
tonight and we're extremely proud of their work as well as the work of their colleagues back in their buildings and
1:27:24
um appreciate them all and uh the work you've done this year and I know you'll continue to do when I'm home relaxing.
1:27:34
Thank you. Any questions? Yes. Does the board have any questions? I have one. Um
1:27:42
so every first of all thank you all for such amazing job embedded professional
1:27:47
development in your buildings with your unique learners at your levels. Um it is
1:27:53
evident the dedication each and every single one of you has to the students in the classroom. Um thank you very much.
1:28:01
Um, every single one of the presenters today addressed student engagement. And
1:28:07
so I'm just curious, how do we define as a system student engagement? I would go
1:28:14
back a little bit to I think Abby mentioned it about not just the compliance of following the directions
1:28:20
of what the task is at hand, but actually engaging in the learning. So if you're, you know, if you're being I'm
1:28:25
thinking of phonics because you did a lot with the UFly. Um, so you know, you you can look like you're really doing what you're supposed to be and not along
1:28:32
and all the things, but like actually doing the writing, doing the the movements, you know, all of the Yes.
1:28:38
Hands on um all of that. So kinesthetic, you know, learning all of those pieces
1:28:43
that come together that really show that your your brain is working and that your body is working with it to bring all of
1:28:49
those pieces together, not just, yep, I'm doing what I'm supposed to be. So that's been kind of how we've talked
1:28:55
about it. I will say I don't know that we've defined that with every teacher in every classroom. Um so that's something
1:29:00
that we certainly could think about but um just in the work that we've done that that's how I would define what we've
1:29:06
talked through. Any other questions?
1:29:14
Thank you all very much. I know when the they brought the idea of Wednesday early outs to the board, there was a lot of
1:29:20
conversation, but it's very clear you're making the very most of that time and I know there's countless hours that went
1:29:27
into the planning and Dr. Kren has been talking to us about it all along, but really good to hear about it a more
1:29:33
granular level from from all of you. And then maybe just finally, Rox, thanks. I
1:29:38
I know we're headed down the front stretch here, but uh you've been fantastic and I think I can speak for
1:29:45
the entire board. You'll be missed, but uh we're also very lucky to have had you these last couple years. It's been a
1:29:50
pleasure to serve here at DCG and I've loved every every day of well pretty much every day of it. Yeah. Well, but
1:29:58
seriously, we have something pretty special here at DCG and it's been an honor to be a part of it for two years. So, thank you. Thank you very much.
1:30:07
[Applause] Miss Kale.
1:30:22
Well, good evening. I'm Deb Kale. I'm the principal at Dallas Center Elementary and the preschool director for the district. So, thanks for
1:30:29
allowing me to speak. I also want to thank Dr. Bloom and his collaboration with our building and the other folks at
1:30:34
central office. we really appreciate. Um, as we plan forward for Dallas Center Elementary, um, tonight I just wanted to
1:30:41
talk a little bit about our kindergarten team. Um, currently we have Miss Jungle um, who is our teacher and Miss Kathy
1:30:48
who is our associate and Kelsey um, Stratton has spent a lot of time in there. I probably should have put Miss
1:30:53
Deacy's picture up there as well because she has spent a lot of time with some of our little kindergarters, especially at
1:30:59
the beginning of the year for that transition time. So, she's a very integral part of that team. So, just
1:31:05
kind of looking forward, I wanted to talk about three different points tonight. One was um why we would want to
1:31:11
allow class size beyond the district cap again for for kindergarten. Some of the kindergarten supports that we plan on
1:31:18
having in place, but particularly I wanted to talk about the parallel teaching that we have in store for that.
1:31:24
Um so, why do we want to go beyond the capsize? Well, one, we want to keep all of our Dallas Center families with us.
1:31:30
So we do have like late moveins and things like that. We want to keep them all together because I know from past
1:31:36
experience when they are go to another school it's hard to get them to come back because their kiddos develop good
1:31:41
relationships and you know I understand that completely. We also want to just continue to build that enrollment um and
1:31:49
um showcase what our kindergarten classroom can do. Um, just as a little side note, um, out of our 20, I think we
1:31:58
had all but one of our kindergarteners proficient on our fast assessment, which is pretty awesome. So, I thought that
1:32:05
was a great tribute to Miss Jungling, the work that she does, and how she builds collaboration around that room.
1:32:11
So, we want to continue to build that amazing thing. Um, we also want to encourage other um, open enrolled
1:32:17
students to um, support our district growth and enrollment. So, not only for our own building, but for the district
1:32:22
as a whole because as we talked earlier tonight, we want to keep that enrollment going and we have to build quality
1:32:28
things and that attract those families to us and um we can do that at Dallas Center as well. So, some of the
1:32:35
kindergarten supports that we will put in place um is we will keep Kathy, our general education associate, um and she
1:32:43
can continue to support Miss Jungling in the ways that she's been doing. Um intervention support is key. our two
1:32:49
interventionists. Um, we have a full-time one, Audrey. Um, oh my gosh,
1:32:55
I'm having a Stein. Sorry, Audrey. Didn't mean to forget your last name. Audrey Stein, who is has been with us
1:33:01
for years, and she does a great job. And we have Erica O'Brien, who is our part-time interventionist. And they get in there within that first week and
1:33:08
really diagnose those students so we can know immediately who we need to support. And they start building those
1:33:14
relationships. They push in. they get to know the the kindergarteners so that they feel comfortable coming them to
1:33:19
them for that intervention because we know early intervention is key. Um well
1:33:24
the third bullet is kind of a celebration but I'll let
1:33:29
Mr. Dr. Bloom talk about that. Sorry about that. Bloom. Um but we want to continue to keep Mallerie in that
1:33:37
position of welcoming those kids when they first come in. it is a big transition for those five-year-olds to
1:33:42
come to a full day program when they're used to maybe a half day or not a program at all. And so she was integral
1:33:48
in really helping with the crying and the missing the moms and the dads. And so her her um guidance and that uh her
1:33:56
kindness is just really appreciated. And Fog of course is a huge hit with those 5-year-olds. So that always is a big
1:34:03
help as well. Um Kelsey of course is a great support as the instructional coach. she is able to coach and to guide
1:34:12
and to model and to give feedback to um Miss Jungling in very um amazing
1:34:18
capacities to and as a first year teacher she's done amazing. So um she
1:34:24
really takes that feedback and utilizes it and of course we'll continue with the administrative
1:34:29
support. So parallel teaching, this will be something new that we will try next year. And so with if uh with the class
1:34:37
of 26, we'll divide it in half and we'll try to think about to make it just equal, not a high or a low class, just
1:34:43
split right down the middle. So we have two alike uh sections. And during whole
1:34:48
group instruction, Kelsey Stratton, the instructional coach, will take one half and Miss Jungling will continue with the
1:34:54
other so that they're getting the same instruction but with a smaller group. So, we talked about student engagement
1:35:02
and then during this whole group instruction with that smaller group, both Miss Stratton and Miss Jungling
1:35:08
will be able to tell if those students are engaged during whole group instruction. I think that that is key.
1:35:13
So, I think that will be a key role for those two. And they'll do a lot of their planning together. They will be a PLC
1:35:19
and do their weekly planning together. So, they're teaching exactly the same thing for both groups. But then the
1:35:26
small group and the literacy stations will be then run by Miss Jungle and Miss Kathy um in the
1:35:33
classroom. Any questions about parallel
1:35:39
teaching? And that would be it. Short and sweet. Board have any questions?
1:35:47
This is all really exciting. Yeah, it is. I love the idea of parallel teaching. Um, I think that seems like a
1:35:54
really great compromise for Yeah. Um, having the number of students that we
1:36:01
need to have, but also make sure that we're doing the best we can by all of them and our teachers, like 26
1:36:07
kindergarters is a lot. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, the really great thing is Miss
1:36:13
Jungling really scaffold that at the beginning of the year for this group. And so this group had an extra recess in
1:36:20
addition to their others the first month of school. So it was 15 minutes about
1:36:25
9:30 she would take them out because that was about the time that their wiggles were really getting in. And then
1:36:30
every week she just decreased it by a little bit by a little bit by a little bit. So then pretty soon it was nothing
1:36:36
and they were able to stay engaged the whole morning without that extra recess. They still take brain breaks, you know,
1:36:42
and things like that and get the wiggles out and get their brain refocused, but yeah. So, very cool. Yeah.
1:36:51
Any other questions? Thank you, Miss K. All right. Thank you.
1:36:56
Have a good um Dr. Krenz, I think u I think we maybe have a couple that want a
1:37:02
quick break here. So, maybe we'll just um one or two minutes and then we'll get back rolling again here. Is that okay?
1:37:08
Yeah.
1:41:01
All right, Dr. Corenza, thank you. Okay. Yes. Thank you. So, a couple of updates I want to provide for you tonight. First
1:41:08
is Sia. So, there's good and bad things about having SIK scheduled for May is
1:41:14
that there's a lot that can come up. And then it didn't hurt that it was like a 72 or 75 degree day. So we um Dr. Bloom
1:41:21
and I made the decision. I think it was actually the best one to just postpone that meeting. You know, part of SCAK
1:41:27
because we try to make it interactive and building principalled it just if you don't have enough people it and it could
1:41:34
be really hard. So what we did is we put together a that presentation is just now
1:41:39
moved to an asynchronous uh virtual presentation. So, that will be sent out here in the next day or two. Um, and
1:41:47
we'll just gone over the content that you can see presented. But I um that aside, I I do want to say again uh how
1:41:55
much I appreciate that team. I think for me that is meaningful in a number of ways is a we get such good feedback from
1:42:02
parents that ask really thoughtful questions. There's a slide in there that you'll see that um talks about just how
1:42:08
do we use their feedback and what do we do? So there usually a quadrant like a four grid quadrant where people put down
1:42:14
ideas and I know that from after that meeting it comes back and is discussed administratively or we look at it behind
1:42:20
the scenes and a lot of those improvements that are happening are because principles are hearing that firsthand from the parents um they're
1:42:26
getting a feel for what people might need or want more of. So I want to thank everyone um that's on that team,
1:42:32
parents, community board members, uh staff because it is the dialogue and discussion has been great. So right now
1:42:39
we're in the process of collecting the names for people that are interested for next year. Certainly it's nice to have
1:42:44
some capacity. If people want to stay on, they certainly could. Um and then you know we have some that can come in
1:42:50
as a community member at any time. So questions about SCAD. Okay. Teacher quality. Um that
1:42:58
also we had our last meeting in May. This is that group the half administrators half teachers where we
1:43:03
looked just at what are we doing from a professional development lens. uh we went and reviewed kind of the tie for
1:43:09
our professional development. Next year will be uh looking at the strong framework. So those things that they
1:43:14
talked about tonight in our presentation and uh merging together professional learning communities. We have a
1:43:20
framework now for both. We have our feet in both worlds. What we need to do is just clarify expectations. We need to
1:43:26
start thinking about how when we collaborate together, and I think everything you saw up there screams about the importance of collaboration,
1:43:33
but then how are we starting now to use data and to look at those engagement methods and what we're doing, the
1:43:38
strategies in the classroom to drive student instruction performance. So, um, we we went over a little bit of just
1:43:45
what does that mean to each of us and how would we blend those together? And, uh, Mr. adjustment over there. He put
1:43:51
together just some more information finalizing our classified staff evaluation piece and also kind of
1:43:57
clarifying expectations around the individual educator professional development plan or
1:44:03
IEPDP. And uh we will tighten up our reigns a little bit around peer coaching. I'm I'm pretty excited about
1:44:10
that. I think there's a great opportunity when we get teachers into each other's classrooms uh to the best extent possible. just opens up like,
1:44:17
hey, here's some new ideas and things even if they're not in the same content. So, um, we will that team I've already
1:44:24
been told by Tom Clark, our DCGA um, leader, that that group is staying
1:44:29
the same. So, we will actually be into a third year um with that group and have
1:44:34
built quite a quite a bit of professional learning knowledge around the work. So, excited for
1:44:39
that. Uh, third is our professional development schedule. You can just see the dates and the information about what
1:44:45
we're doing. We're now in the home stretch as as Ryan kind of alluded to. It's building, so they are wrapping up
1:44:50
with building goals, wrapping up their PD, obviously doing some some strategy
1:44:55
sessions. So, right now, um, state reporting is going to ramp up here a little bit, uh, as we close out the year
1:45:02
and make sure we've accounted for all of our students that way. Isas, we're just waiting. We have interim data back. So
1:45:08
I'll be presenting hopefully in June about our ISAS data and just trends that
1:45:13
we see and also as along with our building or our district and building
1:45:21
goals. That's all I've got. Any questions?
1:45:26
All right, Dr. Blue. Okay. Thanks. All righty. I will uh do the first two topics together and do some celebrations
1:45:32
and then some challenges. We're going to start with the celebrations. It was neat to have RSP here. Historically, um, as
1:45:40
Ryan mentioned, they are very, very good and very accurate. So, I'm, you know, optimistic certainly, we, you know, are
1:45:47
we're in a blump, a blip, excuse me, for two years, maybe even a third year. We'll see. But over the course of time
1:45:54
with their projections, hopefully we get the earth moving. And great to hear from uh, Mayor Byer and his team about, you
1:46:00
know, hopefully they can get the earth moving, too. So, I'm I'm optimistic that it's coming back. We're we're in a tough
1:46:06
spot right now, but coming back um and that goes along with our home building permits. From November through the end
1:46:13
of March, we had 29 building permits in the district for those months. And in
1:46:19
April alone, we had 49. So 49 permits pulled in uh Grimes this year. So that's
1:46:27
outstanding. That's at least a good positive step. So those two are the positives. Um the challenges right now
1:46:33
are a little bit more of the front and center and that is with our enrollment. Um we're down um about 65 kids from
1:46:43
October 1st. Um so that's you know we're just we're dipping down a little lower
1:46:49
and um I went up and and looked up after RSP just to make sure because you do see
1:46:54
the kindergarten senior year kind of do its thing. Our current kindergarten class, so registered in the system kids,
1:47:03
is only 199. So that's uh that's down quite a
1:47:09
bit. So if we're going to graduate about 260, we're 199. We get a dip in that
1:47:15
junior class, but then it goes right back into the high twos, low threes. Then after kind of that fifth grade
1:47:21
group, it kind of just trickles down. So again, maybe a little messy in the
1:47:26
foreseeable future, but hopefully the the positive is is just right around the corner. So wanted to share those
1:47:32
updates. Um so class size, uh we or 63 was the estimated decrease. There's my
1:47:38
math. Thanks. Um great to hear from Deb. So we've been working closely with her. Um we have
1:47:45
23 currently uh enrolled kindergarteners that live in Dallas Center. And then we
1:47:51
have three families that have requested to open enroll in kindergarten to DCE.
1:47:57
So they're outside the district. So that's when again I met with Deb and her team and said, "Hey, like I I think it
1:48:04
looked like it went really well. This jungling is amazing, but families were a little bit nervous about that size." And
1:48:11
so they went to work and they are adamant that they've got that this is a good thing. So, this keeps all their
1:48:17
resident kids in for sure, but also allows the three families from outside of DCG to stay. So, um she was kind
1:48:23
enough to present some of their plans. Uh but also just wanted to make clear that this was kind of a Deb and team
1:48:29
decision to uh do this neat work. And so, um excited for them. There is no change that we're proposing in the
1:48:36
guidelines that you um will look at a new business, but just wanted the a little bit of the context behind the
1:48:42
kindergarten class. Um remember for DC2 we did uh up the section in
1:48:47
kindergarten. So they're actually gaining as kindergarten section as well to two. So um a lot of good things there
1:48:53
but again no class size adjustments that we are proposing. Um legislative update.
1:48:59
I have a huge celebration from last month for our legislative update. U we talked at length about the property tax
1:49:06
bill last month that did not go through. So, a year from now, my gut is we're
1:49:12
talking about the same thing. But again, for the immediate needs of DCG, this is going to allow us to go to our families
1:49:20
in November. And to be honest, it's an extra um emphasis on why we got to pass this
1:49:26
bond this November because if they mess around with property taxes next year and we haven't passed this bond, were back
1:49:34
into a world of trouble. But now, full go. get the biggest amount we can.
1:49:40
Michelle and I will connect with Piper Sandler who does our bonding work. We will get our game plan together.
1:49:45
Facilities team is going to meet again next week to really start to prioritize the game plan ahead of summer. So,
1:49:52
exciting news, bonding work full steam ahead. So, good news for our residents
1:49:57
and for the school certainly. Uh staffing update. I want to give two um
1:50:03
very big positive staffing update. So, I mentioned in February that uh we spent a
1:50:09
lot of time doing doing right by the data, by the plans, by trying to take care of uh Heritage and DCE and we asked
1:50:17
Mallalerie to spend a portion of her day at Heritage for the morning. Also mentioned at that meeting that what we
1:50:24
would do, I wanted that in front of Mallerie and Heritage as fast as possible, but at the same time, we doing
1:50:29
our homework behind the scenes. So, we've done a lot of homework behind the scenes. I've met with Deb, Diane,
1:50:34
Mallerie, and Courtney, and we've tried to put schedules together and prioritize different things and try to take care of
1:50:41
of all the ins and outs that the um you know, it's critical for school counselors. And long story short, it
1:50:48
didn't mesh very well. And that's to no one's fault, not getting creative. That's just it got a little muddy of
1:50:55
what time Mallerie needed to leave and when we wanted to make sure all the kids saw. And we could only do counseling
1:51:00
guidance. We couldn't do any small groups with her because she had to be back by a certain time. We couldn't do data collection. There was just a lot of
1:51:07
things that became a little bit of a challenge. So, um, what I'll be posting for, and remember at the beginning, we
1:51:13
didn't need a halftime person. So, wanted to do right financially as well. So, what I'm going to be able to post
1:51:18
for and be very confident we're going to be able to snag is a counselor that will work less than halfime in our building
1:51:25
just for heritage support. This is going to keep Mallerie at DCE full-time. And this will allow Heritage to have the
1:51:32
support they need and probably um to no one's fault, but some extra flexibility
1:51:37
within the schedule that they're going to be able to uh do without a hard stop for Mallerie schedule where she had to
1:51:43
be there at a certain time, leave at a certain time. So, this is going to allow uh I think wins across the board. We'll
1:51:49
spend a little bit extra money. Um but I am confident um kind of me as you said
1:51:54
you know last time that that dip into the credit card I think is going to have some real advantage advantages
1:52:01
um beyond the dollar amount because again of the flexibility and really keeping full-time and acknowledging
1:52:08
where this also started is heritage is twice the size and needs the needs additional support to be frank. So I
1:52:14
told them very clearly it's a one-year deal like we got to keep analyzing numbers and doing this again. We do it for every job, but excited for that
1:52:21
announcement. Um, so we'll get that rocking. And then u the other staffing update for right now in person. Um,
1:52:28
excited to share with you Mr. Blackmore who has uh graced us with his presence. Wants to say hi to you all, but he is
1:52:35
going to be our new high school uh principal if you all prove him this evening. So sit and watch the vote right
1:52:42
in front of you. Um but we spent a lot of time in this process excited about
1:52:48
Travis moving to the operations role. Um we had a team of 20some people uh led by
1:52:55
Carrie in in uh in the interviews from from high school staff and actually did
1:53:00
a couple rounds of it to make sure we got the right person and we got the right person and then some. We have a um
1:53:08
Ogden High School principal to a superstar at Carile High School as principal and then North Pulk snagged
1:53:14
him at the district level because of his work. And uh he reached out and showed
1:53:19
his interest kind of when it when it became reposted. And to be honest, I said, "Matt, you got you got to tell me
1:53:24
you got a nice district level job. North Poke's a heck of a school district." And he just as candidly as can be said, "I
1:53:31
just miss kids. I miss the high school environment. I actually miss going to the events. I miss the interactions in
1:53:37
the hallway. And you know, kind of moved me when he said, I just I love North Pole. I'm doing great things in North
1:53:43
Pole. It's a wonderful school, but my impact is is at the kid level. I just kind of miss the day-to-day impact with
1:53:50
teachers and kids. So, um, for us to be able to snag this quality of a person to come to DCG is is a home run. So, just
1:53:57
want to celebrate Matt and excited, uh, for him hopefully in a little bit to be
1:54:02
joining us. And last but not least, I had the opportunity, a quick celebration
1:54:07
opportunity to go to um Iowa State on Friday and participate
1:54:13
in their education courting ceremony and was just neat to see students from
1:54:19
around Iowa, actually around the country. There had to be over 200 students that were getting their
1:54:26
education degree. So, you know, we talk about the challenges of teaching and they're real, but I'm telling you,
1:54:31
there's for every negative challenge, there's 99 positives to being a teacher.
1:54:36
And so, they're still coming. We're going to grab them. There was three or four of them that walked across the stage that said, and my job next year
1:54:43
will be at Dallas Center Grimes. So, I inappropriately made a noise to celebrate them. Um, very excited, but
1:54:50
just want to share with you all that. uh you know it's got its stuff but we've got really really good ones coming to
1:54:57
the teaching profession and starts with your support of public education and teachers and getting creative of how we
1:55:04
take care of them because um our kids need it and Dallas Grimes need it. So just kind of a kind of a proud moment
1:55:10
sitting in that auditorium watching all those teachers walk across the stage. So any questions for me otherwise we'll
1:55:16
turn to Michelle. Okay. Thanks Ryan. You bet. Thank you,
1:55:22
Miss Warmouth. A quick look at the revenue and expenditure summary for the month ending
1:55:29
uh or the month of May 2025. Thank you for your patience while we waited for payroll to conclude and upload those
1:55:36
today. You'll see we're at about 80% of expenditures of our listed
1:55:42
appropriations for the year, which is right in line with where we have been in the past three years. uh we strive to
1:55:50
have all ordering uh for the new year done by this period of time and so this
1:55:56
reflects that. Also looking a little further down at revenue received for the
1:56:02
year, we're at about 90% of the revenue um appropriation received for the year.
1:56:08
So uh looking very good in that aspect. Moving forward to the public
1:56:13
budget comparison which is also uploaded today. uh you'll see that we are at 73%
1:56:20
for instruction and all other areas as we compare to the certified budget uh
1:56:26
well under uh the period of time that we are at this year at 91%. Remember as we
1:56:32
move into June June June actually houses three payrolls that would be the June,
1:56:37
July and August payrolls. And so you'll see that come much closer to the appropriated amounts for those areas.
1:56:46
Um, next I'd like to talk for a moment about uh an item that's in new business
1:56:51
tonight and that is the I Iowa local government risk pool through ISF and
1:56:56
Wood River Energy. Um, this is a combined pool of 173
1:57:04
school districts in the state of Iowa. I think with the number joining this year will actually be closer to 190 schools.
1:57:13
um taking advantage of the ability to bulk purchase natural gas on any meter
1:57:21
over a certain threshold and to be able to uh cap the underwriting uh of those
1:57:28
of the risk pool at uh a specific 20% amount through Wood River Energy
1:57:35
Professionals. What this does is it allows us um some budget certainty that
1:57:41
we haven't had in the past. In the past five years, our average natural gas
1:57:46
spending uh has been $158,820 per year. That's with an
1:57:52
estimate to finish this year. But in FY23, uh our spending was 246,000. So there's
1:57:59
certainly volatility in this area. And so by switching to this risk pool, what
1:58:06
we do is we provide some budget certainty. We also give ourselves some budget flexibility with some savings in
1:58:12
the general fund, shifting those costs into the risk pool into the management fund and uh taking uh some
1:58:19
accountability for the professional services being capped at 20% through
1:58:25
this firm. Um this is uh an amount of 171,000
1:58:33
beginning in July 1st. It is one payment of the year. It'll be one payment for natural gas. It's
1:58:39
7.7% over our average. So, it does cost a little more, but it does give us some
1:58:45
additional flexibility. It's a $75,000 savings over that highest year
1:58:51
in the five years or a $23,000 savings over the second highest year. Um, so,
1:58:59
uh, it's my recommendation that we move forward. We have planned ahead in management for this year to include this
1:59:06
type of expenditure. I do want to note to the board that it won't be every single meter. There are some meters that
1:59:12
are very low usage and you have to be at a certain threshold. So there will be a
1:59:17
small amount of natural gas spending in the general fund, but primarily most of it will move into the management fund
1:59:23
for next year. What questions do you have about this local risk pool? Is it
1:59:29
just a one year contract or is it this this is for one year and then the board will take action to renew every year.
1:59:37
The actions that you take tonight uh are a 2080 sharing agreement that bring our
1:59:42
district in with the fold of uh at least 173 other districts in the state of Iowa
1:59:49
to share in those purchasing costs. we do get some advantage of bulk pulled uh
1:59:55
purchasing price for natural gas through this program.
2:00:01
So next time can we look back and see like what we would have spent
2:00:07
that would be very difficult because the therm rate is going to change uh and have volatility and I don't know
2:00:13
how I would do that without bills from the actual uh symmetry and black hills to figure that exactly. I can certainly
2:00:21
compare it to what we have spent in the past and the number of therms we've used in the past.
2:00:29
Well, getting us some general fund relief is badly needed. So, thank you for that. And uh yeah, if we can back
2:00:36
into a efficiency, it'd be good to understand what that is, but uh glad to
2:00:42
see that we're being creative about how to move some spending around uh out of general funds. So, that's awesome.
2:00:49
Uh last I'd like to visit with you about House House Files 2612
2:00:55
ESPSS. This is um education support personnel. If you recall, the
2:01:01
legislature a year ago appropriated $14 million toward uh support personnel uh
2:01:08
for school districts. And um we've looked at a number of different ways. Uh
2:01:14
but because that we were not guaranteed renewal of those funds, we felt that just increasing salary wasn't the way to
2:01:22
go. And so uh our recommendation is to use those for retention of classified
2:01:28
staff. So as you know uh contracts have gone out. Anyone who commits to stay for
2:01:33
the new year based on their years of service would receive a retention stipen. And uh I believe in the packet
2:01:41
I've listed those for you. Ranging anywhere from people that are in their first year of service would receive a
2:01:47
stipen retention stipen of $250. They're coming back the next year. Between two
2:01:52
and five, $350. Between six and 10, $600. And
2:01:58
those with greater than 10 years of service to our school district would receive
2:02:03
$850. So this is for classified staff. and uh it spends
2:02:11
$93,950. Um just barely over what our appropriation for that
2:02:18
is. Any questions on that?
2:02:23
Um I think it says that then so they signed Excuse me. I'm sorry. We're
2:02:29
mathing here and so mathing is not my favorite subject.
2:02:34
Um, if I understand though what I read correctly, upon the signing of the
2:02:40
contract, then the these stipens would be distributed in the June 2025
2:02:46
paycheck. Is that correct? Correct. And should then that staff
2:02:52
member decide perhaps say in August or September to not return.
2:03:01
So there's not a lot we can do at that point. Okay. I'm just wondering and just asking. I understand we have to
2:03:07
appropriate these funds and it's important that they're spent by a certain time frame. Correct. And I agree
2:03:14
with putting the money in the hands of our staff members where we have the greatest turnover. So I just want to
2:03:21
make sure I understand completely. Thank you.
2:03:26
Any other questions? All right, I'll move us along to old business. We've got the second reading
2:03:32
of uh some policies. We got some four, five, six, and 700 series policies we
2:03:38
reviewed last time. Looking for a motion. Move to approve
2:03:44
Dickinson. Second Baker Curtis. Any discussion? All those in favor indicate
2:03:50

like just some wording changes, but, uh, 1 3 4 6 700 series policies. Uh, and
2:04:38
then some updated uh, policies for 2, four, five, 7, 8, and 900 series
2:04:45
policies. Looking for a motion. Move to approve. Viella second. Malberg.
2:04:51
Any discussion? I have some questions regarding the the changes that we're making here. So, it's removing uh gender
2:04:59
identity as a qualifier here as a protected class. Is that um the just
2:05:06
were mimicking state law or state policy? It's not mandatory that we remove that, is it?
2:05:13
Well, this is Governor Reynolds signed legislation removing uh gender identity
2:05:19
as as protected class. So uh this is following IASB's recommendations. So uh
2:05:26
to remove that from the language. Okay. Uh same things will happen to not in
2:05:32
this meeting but uh like for example she signed new bullying and harassment legislation which removed all of those
2:05:38
qualifiers and redefined. Um so you'll see some of those also coming through.
2:05:44
Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Any other discussion? All those in favor indicate
2:05:50
by saying I oppose same sign. Motion carries. Item C, uh, consider contract

2:06:12
Move to approve. Mcnace. Second. Mberg. Any discussion? Is the $140,000 salary
2:06:19
uh consistent with what we're paying now to Travis the current principal? 7,000 more. Okay. And Travis would have been
2:06:26
at 137 for next school year. So a little about 3,000 more. Okay. Yep. And we made
2:06:31
that decision based on commiserate experience. Yep. Yep. Again, as we kind
2:06:36
of talked last month, we got to keep doing that market analysis for these positions. And Matt's been longtime high
2:06:43
school principal at Carlile and now district office. So warranted the 140. Thank you. Yep. You bet. Any other

Is there more back? Yeah, more. Yeah. So, we have a student that moved from North Pulk into DCG. Uh, the
2:08:06
student does programming um for her needs in Winter Set. And so this is an
2:08:12
agreement since she's our student, but to stay consistent for her schedule, North Pulk is going to continue to do
2:08:19
the transportation that this student is used to to and from Winteret, but because they now live in DCG, we we pay
2:08:27
the bill now. Yeah. Okay. Any other discussion? Will this change
2:08:34
next year? Probably. Or this is next. Is this just
2:08:40
the remainder of this year? Yep. This is This is um Let me That's a great question because we've been doing this

2:08:57
Yeah. I'm trying to remember her shoot. I think it is for next year, too. Yep.
2:09:05
Okay. Um And is this the same student? I think
2:09:12
several board meetings previously we approved enrollment
2:09:18
for special education. This is the same student. Correct.
2:09:24
Very good. Yeah. I can Rox has been communicating with
2:09:31
North Pulk to make sure the students taken care of. So I can double check.
2:09:36
I'll just shoot her a text right now and just double check that it's for next school year.
2:09:43
I will tell you it was a win-win for the district as we had limited availability of drivers. Got it. Okay.
2:09:52
Okay. Okay. Okay.
2:10:02
He's already showing benefits. Look at him. He's already Wow. He's already earning it. That's it. Hasn't even made
2:10:08
dollars. Haven't even made Yeah. So maybe returning to North Pole
2:10:15

2:11:30
will be regulated in this room. Is that what we're doing potentially to discuss?
2:11:36
All those in favor or I'm sorry move to approve second Vanderbel. And so to to
2:11:42
answer your question, yeah. Yeah. The I mean in in short what what's happened there's this thing called a doaz unit on
2:11:49
this building. Uh they didn't connect the restroom exhaust to that DOAZ unit.
2:11:55
So it's over ventilating. So you want to balance supply and return. We're exhausting more than we're supplying. We
2:12:01
get it negative in the summertime. We bring in all that hot humid air and that's why the building sweats. So
2:12:06
they'll take and duck that back to that doaz unit and they'll balance supply and return moving forward and it should fix
2:12:13
the problem. Should have been built that way in the first place. Wasn't but uh be able to fix it now. The 23,000 is for
2:12:20
the fix, not just for a study, right? Correct. Yeah. No, it includes there's a set of there's a set of plans in there
2:12:25
and then it saves $1,600 a year in energy cost. So assuming this thing's got 15 years of life left in it, which
2:12:31
it does, it'll pay for itself. Yeah. Sounds wonderful. Any other
