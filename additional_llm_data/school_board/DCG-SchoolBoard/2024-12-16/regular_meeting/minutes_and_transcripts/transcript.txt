motion carries moving on to item five uh approve the minutes of the previous
meeting that would have been from November the 25th uh regular meeting looking for a motion move to approve
mberg second Vander any discussion um yes I just um in reviewing the agenda
had a quick question one of the things that we talked about in Item B um of the
previous meeting was the possibility of work sessions and I know that Dr Bloom
sent out some information over Thanksgiving break and I was looking uh
to see if that information would appear on this agenda in a different agenda item and it doesn't so it seems most
appropriate to perhaps bring that conversation up here through the lens of the previous minutes and find out any
updates on that possibility of setting those dates um when I counted there were
six proposed work sessions that he came up with ideas for and if we go January February March April May right and
there's lots of things coming up and so I just like to be able to get those on my
calendar fair enough um yeah we can um um we can we can probably either cover
that here or we can cover it in in the superintendent update whatever you I just didn't see it in the superintendent
update which is I know we can only talk to an issue if it's on the agenda and so I'm trying to stick it where it seems
applicable and appropriate thank you I I would like to add I do have a update on work sessions and Facilities that I
didn't put on mine so if I talk about it there be great pardon me sorry is it
also possible for under that subsection so 8f where there's the board member option right so there's nothing listed
there I was hoping that that would be a time that we could address the work session thing that I handed out um if if
that's also an applicable place to talk about the work session I'm not sure all right so I think we need to let
this motion fall uh and then we need to raise a new me uh a new motion with
um the um appropriate or the noted changes uh to the
agenda so all those in favor indicate by saying I
I post same sign I motion Falls looking for a minut yeah
that was the minutes oh so we already approved the agenda right which is why
when I didn't see it in superintendent update I just saw strategic plan or
facilities plan I which is why I'm sorry okay um that's why I was trying to make
it fit in the agenda as the agenda is constructed I think but we I don't think
it belongs in the meeting minutes from our last meeting either Bloom sending out an email about the way I have it
listed right now is motion and second and then post vote minutes director
vaker ask for questions are discussed from the previous meeting are not mentioned in agenda she would like to be
able to get any possible work sessions on her calend Dr Bloom said he would address this under superintend
okay all right so let's um yeah we can't do that
um I think we need to go let's go back to item four um and I I think we need
to uh amend the agenda amend item four uh with Y the um agenda item so
there's a facility update under the superintendent report we're going to talk about the board work
sessions okay and then under board member reports Meg you're going to cover this yes pleas content that you sent out
at the beginning of the meeting looking for a motion move to amend the agenda to
include discussion regarding work sessions in the superintendent update
And discussing Meg's workshop and board member updates looking for a second
second second any discussion all those in favor indicate
by saying I I both same sign motion carries we'll move along to item number
five sorry no you're just fine my mistake I was on the wrong uh agenda
item so moving along to agenda item number five the approval of the meeting minutes from 11:25 I believe we had a
first and a second before I don't know who that was from I had the first she
had a second second okay so we have a first and a second any
discussion all those in favor indicate by saying I I oppose same sign okay I
think we're cooking with gas again here all right uh presentation of bills looking for a motion move to approve MCN
second vanderen any discussion all those in favor indicate by saying I I I post same sign motion
carries item number seven the consent agenda looking for a motion move to approve
MCN second mberg any discussion all those in favor indicate
by saying I I oppose same sign motion carries any questions on the written
reports all right uh Mr Hopper's here to speak with us this evening about all things technology Mr Hopper
good evening board how are you doing again um it was just may that I was here last time we switched up the schedule this year so it's only been a few months
since I saw you guys last um but I wanted to give you an update of where we're at the tech department I always like to start with my team um that's
Eric on the left myself Chris stammerman or network systems admin and Barb uh chives on the right none of my
Department's work would be possible without these four people these three people I won't include myself they could
they can and they have handled it on their own um this was a photo AJ took on
it Professionals Day about a month and a half ago um and I again just always have
to Pride take pride in the work that they do and the customer service that they provide um few about a week ago two
weeks ago we had our strategic planning session where we talked about our core processes and uh met with several
different departments um and kind of mapped out what in the tech department what our core processes are um and
you've heard me say these things many times before high quality customer service uh to all of our students staff faculty
um parents um grandparents stakeholders uh pretty much anyone um that reaches
out we want to provide that highquality customer service uh we want to protect sensitive data and the Integrity of all district networks you've heard that
there be another slide a little bit further on um about some of the cyber security stuff that we've been dealing with the last couple
weeks uh ensure reliable Network con connectivity and access to appropriate devices so we're one to one on any given
day we have five th000 plus devices on our Network that includes our student devices as well as personal devices for
Teacher staff uh contractors that might be in the building all sorts of stuff so lots of connectivity going on want to
keep that up and running 100% of the time and then obviously operate within the bounds of our approved budget um
lots of things are coming down we're starting to hear from a lot of vendors with the tariffs coming on board some of those other things that are suspected um
Chromebooks are almost entirely created overseas um they don't create the chips here so if those tariffs were to go to
effect um we expect to see some pretty dramatic um increases on some of those devices so we're watching that very
closely um our vendors of course are jumping in hey get your order in now um but we don't have the money it's
committed to next funding year so we're kind of in that holding pattern watching it as closely as we can um but that will
have a direct impact on our bottom line in the tech department because most of our stuff that has the chips those simply aren't produced in the United
States yet they have to be imported so um something we'll have to watch as we move into next year's budget cycle
uh I always include this this is our list of uh tickets uh we are in what I kind of call our lull between
Thanksgiving and Christmas everyone's just kind of trying to get over to that home stretch um AJ's going to help me put out a notice tomorrow that if you
have something that's not working send in that help desk so my team can work on it over break um we are up over this
time last year about 133% in our tickets um I wouldn't say our workload is necessarily up 133% we're just having
teachers doing a much better job of actually submitting tickets and filing those things where before they might
just swing down to the office and talk to us or give us a call um they're doing a much better job of using our help Des system which is a huge
help um the other thing that I uh threw in here since uh this summer we have
dropped the number of tickets reopen by 4% which means we're getting it right on the first try um that's one of those
metrics that my team and I talk about a lot we don't want teachers to have to go back and forth back and forth um so
that's trending in the right direction uh I thought this month uh for
this update I would would really focus on the Partnerships we've been doing so the first one you may have seen um was
our high school video board our department was really involved with AJ and the activities Department getting
that um and it started with actually this image on the left we were uh AJ
invited us in and they had a lot of measurements and on the wall and it became this very beautiful uh board that
was unveiled on December 6 um lots of collaboration not just between our department and AJ but our department and
activities our department Sean in the operations Department um getting electrical run so one of the many
Partnerships we've been able to do this year uh security cameras our team I
think when I talked to you guys in May our department had just kind of taken over responsibility for security cameras
um this is not me although the bearded guy looks uh very similar uh for about
oh probably two weeks last month if you went into an elementary school you would see kids what's that guy doing in the ceiling CU I would be up in ceilings
tracing wires um I'm going to say we're going to have one of the most um comprehensive security camera systems
that I've seen um K12 um pretty much all of our interior exterior is going to be
covered very well um and we're using safety grant money for that so again fiscally responsible uh and actually I
use this picture you can't quite see it but there's a small Watermark uh I use that with AI um my prompt was imagine a
picture of a network cable installer surrounded by cables and stuck in a suspended ceiling and that's the image it gave me um this was met as AI uh
Facebooks um uh I've been working with Greg shanana their team um trying to work through AI policies how that works
for our district um kind of where we stand now teachers are free to use those tools we encourage them to use those to
experiment with those uh students primarily are blocked not necessarily intentional it's just many of those
services are for 18 and up right now um chat GPT if you read those terms of service it says 18 and up um so we're
blocking those um not I won't say to deliberately block kids from them but
because we want to honor those terms of service it's an ongoing conversation between Greg and Shannon the teaching and learning and school Improvement team
um but I can answer any questions you guys have there especially with Greg in the room uh fiscally responsible we've got
uh there's actually a fourth uh e- rate project you guys have heard me talk about that for years that's uh Federal project gives us discounted rate on
internet and network connectivity equipment um we qualify for a 60% discount based on our free and reduced
rate um we are actually classified as a rural District which is kind of interesting because four of our seven
buildings classify as rural if Oakview was on the other side of the street it would classify as Urban and our uh rate
would drop to 50% as an urban District um so it's kind of interesting just how that that policy Works um so we're on
the good side of that uh every 10 years when the census comes around they'll reevaluate that and that'll have another
impact on us uh but that project this year we're going to do uh basically the second half of our wireless access
points we did about half of them last year um our UPS's our battery backups for our Network so if power goes down in
the building we have a little bit of time um anywhere from four to 6 hours where our Network can stay up and running so um if you're trying to get on
your phone and your phone's got batteries you can call out things like that uh internet connectivity with our
current provider which is Mediacom here uh Mediacom Enterprise little different than Mediacom retail and the one that I
missed up there is our firewall um so our firewall is due to be replaced this year um and so that'll be a pretty big
expense we have one at Dallas Center um serving those two schools and then one at the high school serving the schools
here in Grimes uh currently we have three devices out for bid uh or three
device sale lists out for bid one of them is all of our old Apple devices have about 120 iPads old MacBooks things
like that um lot two is about 300 Old Chromebooks so those are a lot of the senior devices that we collected at the
end of last year and then the other one is some of our Network equipment because we've been able to cycle them up and
refresh them we're putting that out for bid um we do it this way because the amount that we're doing it's probably a
little easier to go straight to buyback vendors I have a list of about 40 vendors that I send out our list to um
sometimes we get lucky and we get great bids sometimes it's very low um if it's very low we'll hold on to them we'll throw them on again in a few months um
we also just did a gov deals for a lot of our smaller things you know document cameras projectors um and I was talking
to Matt today in our warehouse he thinks like most of that sold probably 80 90% of it sold not a ton but it does go back
into our general fund which is good um and then I've been having conversations with Michelle and Bloom about proposed
Bond projects as we start getting into that conversation um Elementary AV things like that um just some things
that we are trying to shift off of the burden of a building budget and maybe work into those bonds um the longer term
projects the better with bonding issues uh and lastly you heard me mention this cyber security some of you
guys may have gotten an email from Dr Scott Bloom which uh I actually had a teacher email me she goes I knew it was
fishing because he called himself doctor um which is good ironic thing is I sent an email alert out to all of our staff
saying hey be on the lookout for it the fishing email within the next 30 minutes eliminated the word doct Scott Bloom so
they were actively monitoring our emails which means it had been compromised we had several teachers identify who they
were they admitted it which was great we immediately changed their password locked down their account secured their account everything we're supposed to do
um but that was the week before Thanksgiving we 100% um affect uh expect
another uh attack just before winter break they do that deliberately they know how busy teachers are they know how
busy our school staff are trying to get everything done um but we had hundreds if not thousands um that came through
the week before Thanksgiving probably boed about 70 80% of it and about 30% snuck through before we were able to
identify staff um good news is no evidence of compromised accounts and with our two-factor authentication that
we require even if they have your password they also need your cell phone and your code number so um very secure
um really a testament to my teach teachers and our staff because I know it's not the most convenient thing if you get logged out unexpectedly um but
it is something we need to do to protect our data and with that I'll take any
questions you guys have on that last slide fishing and so
I'm I guess I'm curious what are they after is it personal identify
information is it Financial what schools are what they call a soft target so it's it's data it's um confidential student
data um being part of an another District that experienced a Cyber attack
they were out to intimidate they got a hold of the texting me messaging system and were texting people don't put your
kid on the bus today so they're looking at things that they can leverage for fear leverage for data it's not
necessarily financial data like you would go after a Fortune 500 company they're really looking for data that
they can compromise that they can use to kind of Leverage districts to pay their Ransom um so hey we have access to your
data we're the ones sending these threatening messages if you want them to stop pay this amount in Bitcoin um
that's pretty much the standard Vector of attack for schools um but but it's the data it's that soft target it's
whatever they can do to make you lose trust in your community when you mentioned um thinking
ahead as we discussed Bond issues and how that technology could potentially
shift into some of those Bond issues What bond would that go into
Pebble or would this be a separate Bond or do you want to take that one Michelle
kind of the yeah as as we discuss the Future Vision for the
district Mrs wman your microphone thank you as we review the future visioning for the district through that committee
one of the items discussed is do we need a bond in the future and so we are talking about technology and security
along with those discussions so this would be a separate bond to the two that we're currently
discussing about having on the ballot or so what's going to be on the ballot is
not a bond it is a I'm sorry excuse me thank you for correcting me yep Revenue
purpose statement renewal is just renewing the local option sales tax purposes that we spend that money for
and renewal of the voted pepal is uh the uh physical plant and Equipment Levy
that is currently in place that we would ask the voters to renew at the same level okay but Nancy you bring up a
great question on point two because Stephen's team relies a lot on those pel dollars as well so when that hopefully
passes that helps him and our kids and then in November when we go to a bond
got it some of these big picture items that Stephen probably can't do maybe the next three to five years with our pepal
funds we could actually make happen a little sooner so we'd like to put him in as a b Bond ISS exactly you'll have to
forgive me I'm I'm confusing Bond and Levy NOP because we've had a lot of
items on our agenda yep and it's all good that's why you saw why I kicked that one over to nope that's fine I just
mixed up Levy and bond and my mind good call we're helping technology with both the p and so that's a good thing you
mentioned on the on the device sales sometimes we get like low bids we just we just hold on to them because it's not worth getting rid of yep would it maybe
this be a year we maybe hold on to them because like if you're worried about prices going up then we don't like how many do we buy year how many do we have
to sell maybe this is the year like we just hang on to them so yeah so we h of those 300 or so that we have now we
actually hold on to about 300 separate from that to use for parts repairs things like that the 300 that are out
now are pretty damaged right there screws the hinges are coming off things like that um we'll part them out if we can um and if they don't sell we
probably will hold on to them the problem with the that particular model is it's no longer in rotation so it's I
don't have it's out of rotation it's a unsupported model now so I can't necessarily cycle it back in um but I
might be able to use Parts I might be able to use the screen off of it and we do that pretty
frequently But to answer your question yeah we I always have it in the back of my head our devices are on a four-year
cycle so they get them in fifth grade and they get them in nth grade um most places will tell you if you get three years out of a Chromebook they're 300
$350 device if you can get three years out of a Chromebook you're doing good if you're getting four years out your kids are taking really good care of them kids
we can push them to five years we do actually have a couple grades now that are pushing 5 years just because of where they're at in the rotation cycle
um but it's tough It's it's a lot of repairs it's you almost think more money into the repairs than even with an
increased cost these companies buy them refurbish them then probably resell them correct Yep they're not bu them to use
correct great question all right well you guys know
where to find me um just shoot me an email um happy to help you guys uh anytime any questions you guys have
thank you Stephen thanks for all you and your team do for the district we appreciate it very much Dr Kenza hi good
evening just a pretty quick report tonight um I want to start with State reporting uh just a couple of updates
the two that I want to three that I want to bring to your attention drop out verification that's already complete we
just go back and look at between October this would have been October of 23 and October of 24 um students that were
marked as dropouts or also includes um kids that moved out of state um so we
just verify those lists make sure they're accurate and we have that completed the other two um we are now
opened up for winter SRI student reporting in Iowa and this is the one this will be important for us as it
looks at how do we code our work-based learning as well which ties to the report card that I talked about so we'll
just go through that we kind of start that work um we initial our initial upload only showed 29 errors that's a
miracle so uh we're in good shape and we'll we'll clean those up and get that ready after January starts and then the
last is our secondary CTE reporting so we'll start to get in there and indicate what our programs of study are and our
coursework that's an ongoing report that happens through the spring um so we'll take care of that questions about State
reporting oh I should say then federal reporting crdc opened this is exciting I
actually um I don't think I told Bloom this but we have already completed the Lea portion um this morning so now all
we have is the reporting for each of the seven schools in each of the those areas so we're off to a good start and um want
to thank everybody who's uh helped get me some data for that information makes it really slick to put it in there but
also the state goes in and imports some of the numbers for us so that helps as well so we're doing good there in that
regard teacher quality uh this is I I just update you generally about October
November through January or so because that's the meat of our work is during that time uh the TQ committee has really
been looking at the evaluation system uh Mr jman has led uh the staff or the TQ
committee members on just a kind of a crosswalk between what does the state say as best practices in evaluation what
do we have in place they're very close um but some things and areas what we might want to beef up or improve that's
really an ongoing conversation that he'll be working us through in that regard so I'm thankful for his leadership and then we also are looking
at our professional development um survey so we do intend and will survey
staff we're looking at uh just basically what questions do we want to ask that will get us good actionable information
as we think about planning and preparing PD also um understanding you know with
our move to the every Wednesday what that looks like and how that's uh have we met our goals in regards to that um
we'll talk a little bit to tonight you'll see about the calendar um we'll have on there for you to approve of a
public hearing at the next months and we will have our finalized calendar to you for that to vote on that evening as well
um Wellness committee I this was great this is probably another one of those highlights because it's an area that
we've really needed to attend to but haven't and I want to thank um Shaye was able to be there Nancy are the two reps
from the board on that committee um and we just really spent time breaking down into our policies so our leadership team
will take the feedback from Wellness uh that we got last Monday and we will it
was last Monday night right and then we will take those and start to edit the policy for improvements which we will
bring to you in a subsequent board meeting maybe in a month or two um but we will run that back back by that team
before we move forward they're really in their infancy so their first uh time are spent on policies and goal setting
eventually that'll move towards more District Wellness initiatives what can we do with staff what can we do with
students but we actually had board members we had students we had staff we had Administration there um community
members members so of the Committees that we've had I feel really good about this for that fact that we have a wide
wide range of Representatives and the last part is our Essa designation requirements this is
just um I just felt it was important to show this out as we discussed last month um both the high school and Oakview are
targeted uh for closing uh needing to close gaps with regards to students with IEPs we're going to continue to meet um
those buildings do not receive Title One funds so we do not have to fill out the Sammy but we will use the documents that
we have worked with before uh to guide their planning which will begin on January
8th um M Dr cren I have two questions um I love that we have students on the
wellness committee can you explain to me how those students are selected or how
they are able to get that position on that committee yeah we would uh let use it as a chance to advertise anybody is
welcome there would be we would never turn somebody down in a student lens so what we did was we took our leadership
planning team that was the team listed there at the top and just ask each of them to see if they could come up with
some names so um we had one student from Oakview that presented last year on our food service program and he's a part of
that team uh we had connections where staff from the high school reached out to individuals that they thought might
be interested this is the toughest that's a it's a great point we would welcome anybody body student wise that
wants to come um most of them find that their activities get in the way of of
their participation I completely understand how busy they are so if any of you have a name of a student um we
actually one of our leadership team members brought their son so we would love to have anybody we we've mostly
kept it uh I should clarify seventh and above for the fact that that's probably
with Transportation I mean maybe their parents could drive them if they're in seventh or eighth grade but High School
can get themselves there also they're a little more willing to speak out and give feedback than an elementary student
might be uh one thing I did like is Chartwells did a a quick uh survey with
everybody there um ask some different questions so I think questions and concerns that we've heard about got onto
that sheet and they'll be at the next uh Wellness committee to answer some of their questions I'm sorry and you had
another one I do um thank you for the update on ASA designation
and as I you were talking you said that because the schools don't receive Title
One funds they won't be completing the Samy correct they aren't required to so
can you talk a little bit about what the Sammy is and I I just with that specific subgroup
of students with specialized learning needs how are we ensuring that um as a
system because my understanding is the same looks at the larger system perspective and making sure the needs of
those students are met in the classroom and through our multi-tiered systems and of support um how are we doing then that
as a district level to ensure that those students are getting access to the same high quality reg curriculum yeah uh so
first off yeah if you in in the Essa reporting if a school were to receive Title One funds then they would be
required to complete the What's the Sammy they actually have several steps a resource allocation review they have the
Sammy they have an action plan and all of those were probably last Comm uh last
completed for us about a year ago so I think um NE neither the high school nor
Oakview received those title funds other buildings in our district do so we don't have to uh we aren't required to upload
or to complete those activities we're going to do something very similar to that so on January 8th um actually over
break I'm going to meet with Mr Donahue and and Cundiff the principles to plan out what that time looks like to answer
your question um both teams I believe expanded if Jones didn't I Know Travis uh Donnie who's High School leadership
team expanded so we'll actually have more representatives there from the than the original team that did the Samy the
Sammy is the self assessment of mtss practices or implementation in the building so it looks at like five
different areas leadership um instruction and it goes around to define the system
I feel like what will be different this time to answer your question is we all recognize we need to come up with
actionable goals so I feel like when we talked in the last review it would have
sounded something more like the district needs to review mtss practices really
broad really accurate but very Broad and so probably after those meetings nothing
really became of any of that step now we need to talk about like let's look at
individual and and uh principal Kiff talked a lot about this going a deep dive into the data from our special
education students beginning to wonder hey what does SDI look like in our classrooms how does that match up with
what's on paper with what's you know what what's actually delivered how does it look like for teachers in the
classrooms to deliver accommodations and supports both in General Ed and in special education that's probably going
to result in a total like self assessment and reflection at the high school level um um but we also talked
about it's while we are targeted for special education and we will work very hard to close that Gap we also don't
want to turn our our eyes away from whether it's our um El student population or free and reduced that we
really need to start thinking about diverse Learners and then the timing is
probably really key for us because we will start school Improvement planning about March so I think they'll have
really good data collection in January action plan planning in February and we can still upload and answer questions to
the state we would never hide that that's that we want to be upfront about what we're doing then we can look at our
our building goals and divide decide what PD looks like so as we're saying hey these are your building professional
development how do you want to Target to that now they may have lots of things they need to to learn about so that to
that for us is that cycle with more specific action steps thank you for clarifying that I
just I know that we had a lot of discussion in our last board meeting about meeting the needs of all those
different groups of students and the uniqueness of this new school profile system and the way that schools are
designated seems pretty high stakes if you have two consecutive years of a designation but the fact that they will
Mark you lower then yeah um and so I just I think it is worth the time to
look at it at a deeper level to ensure that our instructional prac IES which we
know are research based yes are helping those Learners yeah um be successful I
think what we haven't thank you for those comments what we haven't decided yet and because we haven't met is you know are there opportunities for
coaching whether it be an outside aea person or internal person how do you coach and how do we do maybe some
walkthroughs and learning together so we can see what are the practices in the classroom um and and one thing I always
note is it would be easy to think boy we should just have all of the special education teachers in that room because
we're closing the gap for students with disabilities the reality is that's important that they're there and they have that voice but we also are going to
rely on every teacher to be able to provide um you know modified assignments
or accommodations in the classrooms as well to help them be successful and when it comes to say accommodations in the
classroom is it the responsibility of the student to request those accommodations or is that something that
like in my classroom I know that that's my responsibility to ensure that I am
following that student's 504 I'm excited to answer in two ways uh number one we know it's not the students
job to advocate for themselves some students do have a voice and can uh inform what accommodations are are used
and they certainly might even Advocate when something they don't use something anymore that we would take off those
special education teachers meeting with the general education teachers um should be happening that would be a perfect
example of maybe a practice that we want to examine and say hey how aware is our staff of those accommodations um but I
would also add back to uh with a question about adding in our associate trainings we have had several this year
where we've started to talk about when a student has an accommodation how might you accommodate that in reading or math
we've uh given them already once already a time to meet with special education teachers just in the rooms that they
work in to discuss questions they have as they're obviously helping in many cases not all but in many cases to carry
out that students IEP and get them the services I feel like we've closed that's exciting for me because while we may not
be perfect we're certainly closing some major gaps where that very situation of somebody not getting something could
happen thank you for your Clarity around that thanks all right any other
questions thank you thanks Dr Dr Bloom alrighty well let's start with we
had no new updates um on building permits as you saw there so we'll just keep monitoring that hopefully
Springtime they get rocking um enrollment so two key numbers that I'm
sure you reviewed but I will just share in that document kind of in the red there we look at 2024 certified
enrollment for Resident students um you see we're down about a little over three
um to where we were from the October 1st to uh that December number in the red
but we are up roughly seven or so students overall when you uh from the October date when you add open androll
students Etc so we're going to kind of keep doing it this way to kind of keep comparing back and forth knowing the
funding comes from the great one there the October number but still good to update because certainly there's moving
and shaking of students throughout the year throughout each month so we'll keep you in the loop on who's here so I'm
going to let my good friend AJ hook me up I've got got about um shoot for a 10-minute presentation we are at the
halfway point um with our strategic planning work and it's been extremely exciting so I want to kind of just
review Greg knows he's going to jump in anytime he wants um to just talk about
where we've been and where we're headed because this has been a fun project want to give Julie a lot of credit at
Teamworks she's a tremendous partner um and what I think I'm as excited about of
where we're at where we're going is literally thousands of voices have been heard in one way or another whether it's
completing a survey it's being in the room um you know it's participating in so many different ways so really neat so
all right here we go so we have done as you look at the game plan with Teamworks as to our assess assess our reality what
do we want our vision to be of dcg then we're going to map out the plan and Implement that plan so if you start on
the left there we are all the way through the theory of action piece and I'm going to quickly go over uh the
items that we have touched on but we are we are headed into the kind of the vision card work which is really going
to start to um lead us to the action steps you know what what does an operational plan um look like for dcg um
throughout all of the variety of things that are that are touched inside our school system so I
will briefly touch on where we've been and jump in with any questions of course
so I want to give tons of credit I know this is a small font but there are 26 folks that come to these every time they
are the district strategic planning team so there are times they've met just as a team and there's lots of times they've
met with community members or um a couple weeks ago we had building leadership teams from each building with
us we had all department heads uh in the room to do some of this work but that is
the core group spread amongst all of the buildings uh to have representation um that serve on the district team and that
is as you can see some certified staff members classified staff members and
administrators so a wonderful team to work with Julie showed you this when we met
back in September but just want to bring it back to our board's view this is kind of a bottom up and out right this is the
work of kind of all of our stakeholders bringing this kind of through this chain
um up to the top where eventually you all right will will kind of get to approve of what our three-year
operational plan is but it's just again been neat to kind of start with you know
what what are you feeling at dcg what's your vision and then how do we kind of implement that moving forward so not a
top down but but quite the opposite of a bottom up which has been super cool to have all the voices
involved so again sorry if this is kind of busy and wonky but just just so you know this is this is what's coming this
is what we've done and what's coming is we did our leadership system overview that's what you were a part of in
September with Julie where we kind of talked about what's governing versus managing Etc then we spent a lot of time
with our community members and strategic planning team on the story wall and that was where has dcg been so I'll share
very briefly but they put us into groups kind of based on almost time periods and decades so you had teachers and family
members here for 30 plus years to a couple new hires and everyone in between
and then they talked about what was going on in the school system at the time what was going on in society you
know kind of a current events within the school system as well so a neat way to kind of see our history and where we're
going then we had all staff had the opportunity to give feedback to their
departments so for example Stevens's group of three had an opportunity to share kind of what are the strengths and
areas of improvement for technology our coaches did that our custodians did that our Associates and everyone inside
buildings had that opportunity as well so our teaching staff and Associate staff um and then we met and talked
about that that data a couple weeks ago and then what the big survey that went
out to you you probably saw as as parents you ALS your kids got this if they were that 512 what's the daily
desired experience like what do you want for your child what do you want as a teacher in a classroom for life at dcg
so we literally had thousands of kind of survey results and data to look at um so
that was you know a neat part of how do we tie where we've been to where we're going based on what what is the you know
desired goal of of our families students and our staff so vision card down is
kind of what's next we'll create a theory of action we'll then put our operational plan together that of course
will get kind of vetted through you and all of our stakeholders as well and then when we feel good about that we come to
you um and look for uh kind of your approval to move the plan forward and uh
we'll start tackling item by item
okay here is just a quick look at again what I said with the story while was big major
events Trends what was kind of going on in the world it was a very visual so they were like you'd have 2010 to 20120
on a board and that group was putting events on there what was happening in the school system and you just had kind
of this timelight of of visuals and we did that for five different groups well let me just show you how many groups
there were right there so that was kind of kind of the the breakdown so you see a good chunk of Staff but then a handful
of community members that participated as well and again just kind of gave their feedback on each of the timelines
and then that was looked at by the strategic planning team to kind of just highlight the the history of
dcg then we went to what's called an environmental scan with the team so this identified initiatives systems
structures and behaviors and kind of the the wordage the verbiage esta lished
ebbing Edge and emerging right and then what is happening at dcg that meets
those definitions or what do we want dcg to be tackling to make those things you
know actually look like they're going on in real life and so there's kind of those
definitions right Edge it's brand new it's not established maybe happening
somewhere that we can kind of look into emerging hey we're trying it out right we're going to kind of see what it looks
like um talk with other districts about it establish it's tested it's accepted we
do it right it's just built in to what we do every day at dcg ebing is a
decrease in acceptance and energy maybe it's again something that it just it's time to go away right education's moving
in a different direction so um again our community members and staff all had kind of their input from their lens on those
four categories um inside the walls of dcg
Department strengths and need survey so this is what went out to the Departments so I mentioned Stephen you know
activities custodians Etc Transportation they got these series of questions kind
of open-ended questions that they got to list which then we all as a strategic planning team and each department looked
at a couple weeks ago so that's what a department strength and need survey look
like Elementary so this is going to to Elementary staff members right now okay
so if you work in one of our elementary buildings you got this list of questions to give your Insight same thing it went
to the strategic planning team and then all building principles got to kind of look at that information with some of
the BLT members that they brought um to our full day meeting a couple weeks ago
and then there is the secondary one so lot of good good feedback there and and
just reminded two separate surveys this one out just to staff or department heads not the daily experiences that all
family members and folks filled out and here's what here's what came from that so this is Julie's work for us Julie
actually takes all of the feedback and she was able to kind of break it down into themes as well with the team so
when you look at districtwide so whatever your position is within the district so this is Staff talking right
there 227 completed this that what are the positives going on at dcg culture
leadership collaboration a dedication to our kids and then commitment to professionalism and growth so need to
see that those five areas were highlighted um pretty consistently again
whether you're bus driver custodian classroom teacher associate principal those are the five big key strengths so
those are fantastic to see and then where can dcg grow from that same group
of people continue to work on clear communication transparency you know Staffing's talked quite a bit about the
the additional need of Staff um and administrative support behavior management student accountability so so
talk for you know how do we how do we work through some Behavior concerns maybe from our students is there a
better process or protocol that we can go through a collaboration time you know how can we find more time with teachers
uh to get with each other and also to have have some of their additional planning time and then a big call for
resources right and that's physical resources that's technology um a wide range so those were
kind of the five themes of District needs that came from our staff as
well and then AJ if you don't mind buddy can you click this one and I'm just gonna have him scroll oh of course all
right I'll just let me see if I can do this really fast buddy otherwise I will be able to
Rattle it off all right if we
go well he's doing that one of the terms I really enjoyed from the strategic planning that uh when we think about
that upward arrow is from directional ambiguity to directional Clarity and um
you know it's easy when you attend I've had the fortune of attending each one of those sessions but I can start to see
that happening which is so important so regardless of not knowing or understanding what the final outcomes
will be I can very much see how we're getting to that piece of we have a lot
of data to work with but we are really going to get down to what direction and and clear Clarity around what's the most
important part for us so I'm excited about that work thank you all right thanks AJ so at the top just so you know
what we're looking at real quick and and you're going to get all this information as well um that desired daily
experiences so that's when all the kids 512 families and staff got develop like what's if I had my perfect life at dcg
this is what this document ended up covering so again Julie reviewed it with Teamworks but then we did as a so every
one of us got put into different groups on the strategic planning team and they tackled all of these results and so if
you go AJ don't mind like page two
so students and our strategic planning team met in October and this was the
statements that they sent for review based on feedback to our students and
then on the right side 122 this is what they change so this is what they want us to tackle when it
comes to what's a daily life experience sorry AG if I'm confusing anybody if you go yeah right there y again B I will get
this to you so uh took their feedback on the statements because a lot of Pros yep
I agree with that I agree with that or here's here's some feedback of what could could look different so the items
in blue were either added or most likely rewarded
um based on student feedback then AJ if you'll scroll to the next
page there is your statement from staff members again where it was on
10:15 to now their desired State on 122 so you see most were kept the same and
then the two again either added or probably just rewarded and then the feedback from the
families was no change needed they were they were on board with the daily desired experiences from their initial
feedback so that will again help Drive what action steps we take from the
surveys that we've got from staff and departments from the families from the kids and that will help Drive these
Vision cards these action steps and ultimately an operational plan that we'll put out in front of you
so thanks AJ just want to kind of show that's how that document worked and so lastly what what are we doing next so
they showed on that one chart the strategic planning team will meet as a group of 26 to go over what will this
operational plan look like you all will have a you know a kind of a a say in
this and you'll give your feedback on that then the district leadership team kind of gets involved at at a district
admin lens um we'll do the road map so we are you know as part of we talk work sessions here in a second we're going to
need to have one or two with Julie on the Strategic plan like where are we
going to go as a three-year operational plan based on all this work so your input will be
critical um and then like I said ultimately all the way to step nine so I don't read the whole thing for you we'll
get the feedback again from folks based on our our plan we'll get their feedback and all the way toight after that you
have approved it and Senior leadership is now tackling the action steps so that's hopefully where we will go from
January through the end of the school year so we can begin that action step work in June and July and get off and
run it so thanks for letting me do that kind of 100 miles an hour but what
questions can I answer around the Strategic plan where we've been where we're going I think it's been a pretty
positive experience overall for very POS people especially again the number of voices that have been a part of it has
been awesome all this information is super exciting and really inspiring to see all
of these people wanting to come together to to do this kind of work um the questions I have are regarding the
survey since that seems to be how we're getting a lot of feedback and are the surveys something that Julie and
Teamworks provide or are those written inous great question yeah Julie Julie's
responsible so she's using kind of a consistent template that she uses in this work for these questions fantastic
and then when we send those out and get them back are they Anonymous like are they 100% Anonymous yep yep so EX
exactly 100% ninous they go so they would have marked things Meg like you know the the transportation person is
marking I work under transportation or I'm in this building right right um so we can break it down because we have it
by you know Elementary secondary department but that actually goes all to Julie okay and then Julie brings these
documents and results after she's sifted through so fantastic we don't we don't
actually know who filled them we just know the percentage rate of return that's wonderful and probably the best
way to get honest feedback you're right yep wonderful so thanks thank you yeah it's been
fun anything else gang on strategic planning because you're going to be helping us
out sooner rather than later again so be ready okay so thank you for letting me
add um kind of the work session and facility so facility update is very very
quick OPN has started to travel the district with their team and they're doing that
physical kind of assessment of our buildings so they're going to be kind of just looking at all the the inner
workings of of each one of our our buildings here and then starting mid
January they will meet with principal of each building um and a couple of their
member maybe a BLT member admin assistant that type and they were going to talk excuse me educational spaces
with opion as well well hey what's working right now in your building what's not maybe working so right now is the kind of the physical layout part
they're reviewing and assessing then in January their next step is talking educational spaces with that team so
they'll be behind the scenes for the next several months and then we'll be talking about kind of their report and
start prioritizing hopefully in a similar timeline of strategic planning so we're often running in the summer of
what to tackle and I'll just give Greg more things to do so that be kind of how I Envision that right um and then work
sessions so thank you for those that were able to give the feedback where I'm
curious if we can go and what I would like to do is later this week send you all kind of a recommendation of some of
the topics that I got your feedback on and maybe when would be a good time to put those topics into our calendar so
you're GNA beat this up when I email to you what I am what I tively was thinking
was January February April and May simply because March can get kind of wonky
with um you know spring break and stuff but if we want one we'll get one but I was what I was my plan was with your
feedback coming here's a couple of the maybe four or so topics to do a work session on and what I thought at least
we had a fighting chance to do was do it the the Monday kind of opposite when
board meetings are so you know think of the second Monday of a month January February April May and then the board
meetings two more again I'm I'm if everyone can't be there we'll figure it out but what I will tentatively do is
send you an email with a date and what I believe would be maybe an appropriate
topic for that date but you certainly are going to be able to give a that doesn't work for me on the date and B I
I'm not sure that's important but for those that got a chance to respond you kind of shared what you were interested
in and so I think some of the stuff is just going to be timely of when the Strategic plan needs to happen is a
pretty specific time facility plan you know we'll talk kind of budget stuff
with Michelle at at the appropriate time as we kind of do um those are typically
Clos sessions you know around negotiations but we'll still be a learning session so if that feels okay
with with you all that will be my homework assignment is rough dates and
topics is that seem okay yes please you can get this email To Us by the end of
the week so we can hopefully respond to you by the end of the week as well got y perfect thank you yep I will get that out to you
guys and then if that's okay then I guess I'm done and so make can maybe do
the the board andless you guys had questions for me before the next item oh last thing sorry Ryan I'm cheating
because I'm adding this you all later on I think are going to uh approve resignations and retirements and I
wanted to make sure on my part that I again I I think these people will we do
some neat stuff you know throughout the year but we're talking about some history at dcg and it's their time to do
their next adventure and journey that have huge like Legacy lasting impacts on kids and their colleagues and whether
they're resigning to do moving or a neat thing with family or or retiring my extreme gratitude for my
position for what these people do and have done every single day so I just want to make sure I said that for you
guys do your approval thing so with that I'm done thank you great miss
wouth Push pause it's no go ahead
sorry in review of the revenue and expenditure sorry uh no I go after Michelle yeah
okay great I hadn't forgotten about you I just wanted no no you're okay y she jumped the gun I did I got really
excited so excited sorry Michelle it's okay review of the revenue expenditure
summary for uh December 2024 you'll note that this is before payroll ran you'll
see we are 31% of uh expenditures of the planned
Appropriations and uh that's right in line with where we have been in previous years as well as uh at 36% of
appropriated revenues for the year a little bit under uh where we've been in in previous years it kind of depends on
where the December board meeting Falls um so uh no nothing really to note um
much for that 50% through the year also looking at the public budget comparison
report where we look at the four specific areas in the certified budget and compare where actual spending is to
determine if we need to amend the budget at this time we are under in all areas
at 50% through the year and at this time I'm not U recommending an
amendment finally uh I would like to review the Dropout prevention uh program
in the district the our district has had Dropout prevention since the 98 99
school year and it is a program where the state allows up to
75% of the 10% of regular program cost to be provided and allowable growth and
funding in 25% to be a match or commitment from the district to match
those funds from the State uh the district match amount uh proposed for next year is
$449,500 allowable growth and funding from the state is 1,348
537 for a total Dropout prevention at risk program of
1,798 49 um that is about the same amount as
last year just a slight increase and um uh currently we are
spending all of the at risk dollars plus some on at risk this will be an
application to the school budget Review Committee and I will ask you to review that in new business tonight and to
authorize us to move forward to the school budget Review Committee for approval to continue the Dropout
prevention program in the district you have any questions on
that that's all I have thank you Michelle uh Meg um I had
the uh exciting Adventure I guess of last year from the iasb conference um
winning an informational session or work session with um the law firm fan fredman
and fulfrost um at the time they were new to the area from California and
during my conversation that I had with Mr Fagan um he was very excited about
their firm's work with artificial intelligence in school districts and while they do a number of things and can
do like your general um legal representation they also do have Specialties right as most law firms do
um while we never took advantage of that last year um this year at the conference
I swung by their Booth again and asked if they would still be willing to honor that and they were it was a very
enthusiastic yes so in an effort to also uh provide work sessions and uh ample
opportunity for us at the board but also as a district as you can see in the letter that is that I handed out um it
can be for as many members of our team as we want it doesn't only have to be board members it can be administrators
it can be teachers it can be whoever would benefit most from this kind of
work um so I guess I'm presenting this not only as a huzzah we won this thing
but a looking for feedback from the board um or the administration present
what would you like to see us learn what would you like to discuss um so you'll
see like page three has a list of possible workshops I'm sure if we wanted to go crazy we could ask for more um
there is a little bit of overlap with the proposed work sessions that bloom sent out and what is available here so
it wouldn't necessarily have to be work that we come up with on our own um to discuss but it's available so I guess I
just wanted to open some dialogue here and provide this additional opportunity to expand the
conversation it's kind of interesting you you hearing stepen tonight and I had
a question but I didn't really know how to maybe phrase it so I'll save it for another time but I mean AI does feel a
little bit like the wild west just in terms of everything uh it sounds like it's pretty
restricted you know today but I'm not sure that's gonna hold forever and and understanding legally what um you know
how we stay compliant I I think that's interesting and I did also um attend the
breakout session that um I think it's 3F or F3 or however they uh made their name
cuter um F3 thank you um they did a breakout session at the IB conference
about a in the classrooms and that was absolutely fascinating granted was only like a half hour 45 minute breakout
session so like two hours on that 100% could be beneficial sorry to interrupt does does the district have
other avenues that um our staff is getting training um legal
consultation um experience with with AI or is this still young enough that we're
still trying to figure it out yeah I I would air on this it's young enough we're figuring out we had um
Harland gal her name's escaping me now Amy thank you Greg she came um and met with our whole admin team and really
talked about the pros from a staff lens of what Ai and resources could do so
that's why we've kind of got um a little bit of protocol with Greg and Shannon and Stephen of like hey when you want to try new things as a staff like
essentially kind of keep us in the loop to make sure you're not spending a bunch of money or doing something you shouldn't but it's like trying new
things what again we haven't learned a whole lot about yet is when is it
appropriate to filter it down to kids and what does that look like so me I'm
wondering do exactly what you went to with that fit vers like these get kind of specific which maybe is good on this
list or is it more broad a little broad with what you probably saw and now you've got teachers in the room like
right um so the breakout session that I attended was quite broad it was very
broad Strokes kind of about like how AI works and how it uses um this General
kind of fund of information that when you put things in it doesn't it doesn't
belong to you it's no it's not proprietary information so even though it's locked down within the AI it's
still building on itself because of what everybody puts into the pot is kind of how I understood that and so as as a
result the things that can come back can be problematic because you don't own
your own stuff like you're I'm okay so for everybody on the internet I don't actually know anything about
AI just what I heard um that um so like
if dcg had like this is dcg AI That's not the only thing going into it therefore you cannot control the output
and so that's where it can get very hairy for districts um especially if you are clearly dealing with minors if you
are dealing with um unknowns right you don't know how this algorithm is going to interpret what you're putting in
what's going to spit out um and so but even that like the broad Strokes then
get focused in very quickly because it's fascinating and people have very specific questions um then they did get
into like the legality of that and how you want to own the project that you're making but you don't actually own the
project that you're making because you didn't own the parts that went into the project right um there were also
discussions about how that works in um the classroom so like in writing papers or in creating art or in creating you
know what you make with these things and so like the intellectual property elements of that too and from a district
standpoint how do you um make sure that you are Towing the line when it comes to the legality of that right you don't
we're not encouraging plagiarizing in any way shape or form but if we're using um a a
big pot to get our information back from there in lies the question of how
did this creation come to be right is there anything new y I guess y you summarized that well we're just at the
SP where you really did I mean there you're your learning and my learning might be about the same level because uh
we're just at that policy level a year ago we brought the polic model policy from iasb we've dealt with situations
where we Tred try to um you know support classroom teachers that have an interest in this but also realize that when we
start to open it up oop sorry if we start to open it up then what happens is
we could compromise student um student data and student privacy yeah so that's
where we're working hand inand with Stephen but there's also a cap on probably I'm not speaking for shanana if
she's watching but there's a cap on our comfort level of being able to describe this but then you get into bullying and
harassment you get into schoolwork um I just from my seat I think some
learning in that area would be terrific I also think there's districts that are all over the board some that haven't
probably addressed much of all of it at all others in the state that have really
been Forward Thinking in policies so it could be a spring board for us to think
about um where else to go from there absolutely and I would say that while we
may not have students have access to AI say through GPT chat or something like
that AI is in the classroom whether you they're using canva to make projects right that has an AI feature um
predictive text on Google Docs is the result of AI and so being able to
support our teachers I recently had an incident in my own classroom with the use of predictive text and how that
looks with providing accommodations for students with 504s and being able to allow for those accommodations but also
recognizing you can't really shut off predictive text on on Google Docs right
and so we just want to make sure that we're honoring that work you know I use it
myself to run my student work through to make sure that they're not plagiarizing um as a teacher it's a it's
a really powerful tool that can save me a lot of time however on the flip side you know it can be a real challenge as a
teacher if students are using those same resources to produce their work
yeah I would I would like us as a whole at dcg we've talked a lot about it as beyond the exciting Forefront of it not
be scared of it let's own it let's use and be but also be mindful of privacy
follow the laws and the rule like I think we can do both we don't have to shy and be scared of it we can find the
neat ways it really helps us in our lives and teach teachers and our kids the right way but also be mindful of the
stuff that are on on this list and others about how to do that responsibly you know we can do both so Meg I'll
listen to you and the team again if there's a kind of a broad AI scope if you think there's a item on here people
would like to tackle maybe we could come up with an idea and share it with them yeah I'm whatever
you I would love to hear Mr Hopper's input on this as well yeah I think
that's fantastic I can reach out to Stephen want okay I think there's procedurally maybe one of three ways we
could proceed one we could use this as a work workshop topic where you know we
we'd give approprate notice we'd have a quorum of the board and we'd follow a typical Workshop format I think the
second would be this group could be invited to come in to um a space and and
give a presentation the board could be invited along with others but you know
it wouldn't be in the workshop format there wouldn't be um you know necessarily uh work done by the board
the context of a quorum I think the final way would be that it would be more of a targeted group so three or fewer
board members would attend this along with a mix of staff and
administration so I don't know if the board has a preference on how we proceed but I I think we have to have some
structure around what that is um but certainly if it's going to be um
collaboration among board members and we'd want the for and we'd have a quorum then we'd need to do that in the context
of a a
workshop the other thing Meg if if um if it would be better is since we're going
to kind of work through the workshop dates and topics here between now and
kind of the end of the week we could uh also bring this back in
in January if if we felt like there were other priorities that filled those workshop dates then we could take one of
those other options of a more targeted conversation with three or fewer board
members or just an open presentation where the board and others could be um
invited so I don't know if you okay if if you have a preference on how we proceed here if I do have a quick
question if we do the like open presentation um I know that this is
geared towards board members and they said we could invite anyone from staff but what about parents like if we had
come and present on AI and allowed parents and everyone to come when they do that or is it just
more of like a smaller like staff in board I mean I guess it says you can choose it
for anyone it says could be on governance for your
board the leadership team the superintendent and cabinet your site leadership your teaching staff your human resources or business department
Etc um I don't necessarily have a problem opening it up to parents I do
feel like it might be something that could be beneficial if it were something that we could live stream instead just
because from a logistical standpoint I think there would be a lot of parents that would be interested in coming and
this room would get really really full with a lot of people who want to see that and so I don't know again what the
legality of that is they're probably not out there giving away proprietary information for free to everyone um but
it could be something where we take extensive notes and then we distribute that information
through our L too do do you think we'd have as many interested because and
maybe I've got this wrong but it seems to me it's going to be helping school districts Define kind of uh the legal
parameters in which we should be operating into relative to Ai and student
privacy um that might be I mean I think if it's like hey how's the district
going to use AI in the future I agree I think that's be a lot more um probably
interesting to people but my sense is that this is a pretty narrow scope around legality and kind of the legal
curbs around AI I would agree with that and also like on that I think that it would be um important if this is going
to be something that does um influence or help us to navigate how to create
policy surrounding AI it might be something that's beneficial to have as a a structured Workshop or something where
the entire board is represented given that our role is to essentially create
and um enforce Pol or not enforce but you know we're the policy
people did they talk about so what I hear is like this going towards a policy
type discussion which probably makes more sense potentially but typically wouldn't we derive that from the ISB
anyways and then hand down the policy decisions and then us review those so I guess I'm trying to figure out are we
studying policy here are we talking about the Wild Wild West you know what are we actually doing um because if we
get specific typically Would we not just lend it to aisb and have them kind of
come down and then I'm just trying to figure out like narrowing this like what does this look like I it's more of like
an information gathering like just because we don't know enough about it to
I almost see it twofold the first one being let's learn about it and then if there is something from that learning
session that we think could influence or shape the policy that we currently have
that would then consider potentially needing review I think even iasb is in
the process of learning and Gathering more information when it comes to AI um
and I think that at this point even as we look ahead to the legislative
session we don't even know what's yet to come that's what I'm trying to figure out because if we're talking policy it's
like we might be putting the car before the and then stuff comes down like I'm just trying to frame you think the board
doesn't typically just bang out you know policy from a from Whole cloth but but
the interesting thing about this is I think with most policy as it comes through whether it's through your
education your work life your personal life you've got a point of reference on those things and you know as you re read
review policy or even look at other things I think it it tends to be more familiar um than what AI is is and so I
think this is interesting because and maybe all of you I would guess all of you understand this much better than I
do but I think this is certainly a gap if I were to read an AI policy yeah I might understand the legal components of
it but AI as a device to uh learn or use
as a tool I think there's some just real gaps there and so maybe just from that
perspective it could be fruitful for the board at least have at least some
baseline understanding of what it is uh how it relates to you know kind of
things legally and then ultimately when a policy may come from iasb we've got a
better point of reference relative to how we handle it well now I'm asking that because then does that drive us not
maybe having a workshop but more of an information because if it's that's what I'm trying to figure out how this kind of flows through additionally boards can
influence the iasb policies we can we can give them the information that we
have which is something that I learned at the delegate meeting there are lots of districts that propose amendments or
um adjustments to policies or just what drives the boat for iasb in the next session and the next year's worth of
things um so yes we do take a lot of our policymaking decisions from them but
that doesn't mean that they're purely without influence from districts it's not a one directional
precisely if you're okay I might just recommend then we do this I I think we've got four dates that we we
identified I think that there's the potential that we cover more than one Topic in some of those dates or that we
blend some things like potentially strategic plan and master facilities master plan for example may end up those
times work out where we're uh maybe covering that material uh we know the
budget's usually a big one that's going to take one um we also know that uh
we've got some other things that that um Monica and Shaye and I will be working on with the um negotiating committee uh
as well we we'll want to come back and spend some time so that really only leaves one one and a half uh of content
for the four that we have so let's fill those out and then we can decide all right how do we want to get around this
one does it fit do we push it to June do we use a different mechanism other than
a workshop to um interact with this group does that feel okay to the
board it could also be something that we have time for in
March yes yes if we can find a an alternative date in March that works
that would be fine anything else on this topic no
