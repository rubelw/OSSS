Both same side. Motion carries. Uh moving along to reports. Any questions on the written

5:34
Well, it sure is good to be here. Thanks for being here and and supporting our district. Um, as I told the staff, uh,
5:40
when I got to do my small part of the all staff kickoff, um, there's a reason why the Ellingssons are here. There's a reason why my two daughters go to here.
5:46
go to DCG. Uh it's because we believe in what people do here. So, just thanks for being here. Thanks for supporting the
5:52
people that make this district um what it is. We are going to kind of uh go through some of the things that are on
5:58
my to-do list. Each year, I'm going to celebrate some big wins and some goals for the next year. I'm going to start off with this, my fourth year uh as a
6:04
director of communications at DCG. Here's just a kind of a list of the things that have have taken up most of
6:10
my time, my top priority. Mustang monthly uh once again goes out monthly to them every mailbox um in Grimes and
6:16
Dallas Center. I'm really proud of our social media numbers and we'll get into that here in just a little bit. But we've been um more aggressive in this
6:24
new fiscal year when it comes to using social media to our advantage, not only natively but putting money behind it. Um
6:30
and I've seen some strong numbers for there and I will continue to do that when it comes to both hiring posts but also the recruitment and attraction to
6:37
parents uh looking to move here. The Mustang message is our district podcast. Parent Square. I'm going to have a
6:42
special slide here in a second, but I'm really proud of parent square and how it's being used at Dallas Center Grimes
6:47
video board took up a lot of time up in the high school auditori and gymnasium and it was really cool at graduation to
6:54
be able to see that work um showcasing every single student that walked across the stage to have their own have their
7:00
picture on the stage was was a pretty u powerful experience and kind of just like a a sign of yes, this this was
7:05
worth it. And then I just want to highlight the school to work internship program. I've had um two interns um with
7:11
me for the last two years. Um they both have been DCG girls soccer players, but they both have done incredible work. So
7:17
I'm I continue to be a big fan of that program. I would have signed myself up to do that when I was a kid. Um and I've
7:23
been really getting really quality seniors um to join my team and most likely have a third one joining me uh
7:28
starting term two. So just u that's it's been a powerful experience for me, but also I hope for for the kids that work
7:34
with me. Um I'm going to talk about the big wins of kind of what I feel are the two biggest wins um that I see. I'm
7:40
going to talk about parent square just for a second. Um we have 83% of our parents um have active parent square
7:48
accounts. Uh when I first started the goal I mentioned to you was 60%. That meant at least probably one guardian um
7:54
of each student was was active. And and again everybody no matter if you're active or not you get all of the information but when you become an
8:00
active uh account you can sign up for things like parent teacher conferences. you can, you know, uh, bounce back and
8:06
forth ideas with parents sign up for, uh, you know, to bring things for for activities. Um, and to have to have 83%
8:13
and building off of it down in the low 70s last year, it continues to show that people are are buying into the program
8:19
and what it and what it means to uh, be able to communicate and receive information. Off of that, we're up to 21
8:25
different languages used at Dallas Center Grimes. Um, we up that's up from 19 last year. And uh at our last check,
8:32
we have about 125 different families asking um for the information to be come to them in something other than English.
8:38
Um and so I feel like that's a pretty uh important calling at least for me to make sure that that is um available for
8:46
everybody who needs it. So 21 different language, 125 different accounts um
8:51
using other than English. I'm going to bounce onto that to to the D district website. Uh we launched this summer. Um
8:57
and it was my first experience kind of doing it um on my own and and trying to kind of
9:04
the look, the feel, the um just the the amount of information, ease of
9:09
information and being able to have um what the high school needs to be on their front page. It needs to be different than what Heritage has in
9:15
their front page. So I wanted to um offer some flexibility to our buildings, to our secretaries who get more questions so they can easily send people
9:22
um to our website and where they go. Um, and I'm going to kind of the two biggest things I think of from the website is
9:28
our our ebackpack. Our ebackpack is now um you're able to submit events uh to
9:34
that page. It comes right to me and then I publish the event from there. And again, once again, those when they come to me and I publish them through the e
9:41
backpack, they are translated. Um, and so that that's a a great way to get families into our camps, to our clinics,
9:47
to community events. Um, you know, I just did National Night Out and all of the things that that come in there that
9:53
we feel are important for our kids to be involved in both DCG wise um and the communitywise we're able to do that. And
10:00
then I think it also will help um camps and clinics at DCG. We're able to have a direct link that can take them to where
10:06
they need to register. Um and so that just making sure that you know we have so many different place to get involved
10:11
that that we're able to do that. And then again to translation on the website. Um we were able to add we were
10:17
coming from only English uh until this update and now we're using the 11 most used languages at DCG are able to be
10:23
translated on our website. Um but again I think that's a big win. My goal is to kind of expand that obviously but I need
10:29
I needed to start with 11 to make sure that um every the way I was thinking it was working how much of it would be
10:35
translated um continues to do that. So I'm proud of that start and I will work um to do more from there. Um over the
10:42
summer you've seen the DCG creates and I you when we sat together to do the strategic plan when when the create
10:48
light bulb kind of went off in my mind it was like we can do some fun things with that and I and I I really believe
10:54
we started to do that. On the left you kind of see the creating DCG and through the summer we picked uh we actually were
11:00
one at each building um and at different levels um of of what work at DCG and it
11:07
was really refreshing to kind of see um you know natively I didn't spend a dime on this project to kind of see the love
11:14
that people have one for their teachers but two the love that they have for DCG and I think it's a pretty powerful thing when you look through um our social
11:21
media feed for the last month and a half in in a in a kickoff time. Um, you know,
11:26
200 likes and comments and shares just to celebrate people that this the comments people were leaving about, you
11:32
know, this one, Miss Dre makes a huge impact on my life. Like that that's pretty powerful stuff. And so I was able to to kind of see the create take off
11:39
through that and we'll continue doing that throughout the year. The la the middle p the middle poster there is the what will you create this year? We took
11:46
that whiteboard around um in the van um to all of our buildings and ask teachers what they'll create for this year. we
11:52
post it on social media and um you know it it it's a pretty powerful experience to see all of those things on there um
11:58
and and people's hopes and visions and what they're going to create and as they buy in. And then on the right side is the DCG creator award. Um we honored our
12:06
first three creators uh working with closely with Carrie adjustment on this is we um from our feedback staff
12:12
feedback we heard that people could use some more employee recognition and the DCG creator award will do that. um when
12:18
the nominations forms come in, they're tied to one of the core values um of our strategic plans. We'll be able to kind
12:24
of bring that uh document and that vision and that mission to life. Um and so we honored our first three at the all
12:30
staff kickoff and we'll continue to build on that throughout the year. Hopefully we're getting 15 to 20 um recipients. The nomination form goes out
12:37
to our our staff every month and we'll build from there. Uh a couple of goals for the 2526 school year. um
12:44
sponsorships is on there again and I it's probably taken on a little bit of a different um feel than it did last year.
12:50
Last year we were kind of launching it and kind of getting involved and and and trying to kind of match kind of what we
12:55
think the community wants to be involved with with what we can offer here. And now it's kind of also one making sure
13:01
we're doing it um legally as Michelle did you hear me say that Michelle? I said I did. Um, and that that kind of
13:09
comes into like what's what is it? What is the value of seeing an advertisement in the gymnasium during a basketball
13:15
game? Putting a price tag to that. Uh, but then also the second part of that is just the physical space of that. When we
13:21
started, um, the one the feedback that we heard from our coaches was that we didn't want it to be kind of the NASCAR look where there was an advertisement
13:27
everywhere you looked. However, I mean that and that's a very good point. However, there are, as we've noticed the
13:32
last year, there are tons of community partners that want to get involved with DCG. And so, where where do we mesh
13:38
that? And um I think Madison Meltchure is is phenomenal and I've we've worked together on three partnerships so far in
13:45
her short time here and we'll continue to build on that. And I just put on the bond communication when hopefully when
13:50
we get to new business, um this becomes a project that I get to kind of work on um for the first time. And and one of
13:57
the one of the my favorite parts about the job is I get to do things for the first time. And I've never worked on the
14:03
communication of a bond referendum u project before. And so where does my
14:10
role as just the provider of information, not doing anything more than that, but getting the information
14:15
to people so they can make their own decisions. How do I do that? And I'm fired up about it because I think it'll be a cool experience to be involved in
14:21
both personally and professionally as we kind of hear from stakeholders from there. So, I'm really excited about what that potentially could look like. And I
14:28
while I have your attention, I want to just highlight these two I have not been showing on on I'm going to put this over on our YouTube stream here for a second.
14:35
I probably could put 500 faces on this about people who make my job easier, people who help me. And I picked, you
14:41
know, Katie Johnson and Madison Maddox just for um the amount of things that they do to help me. Um Katie Johnson is
14:48
the instructional coach at the middle school. And it just seemed like last year there was a lot of times where there were two or three things going on
14:54
at once and I couldn't make it out to something cool that was happening at the middle school and I could just call Katie and she would always say yes and
14:59
and would take photos and videos and send them to me to make sure that we could cover the story or get the photos that we needed to. So I just wanted to
15:06
make sure like she felt some love and appreciation of how much she helps me. And then Madison Maddock is the uh art
15:12
teacher at South Prairie and she um she's just kind of helped me take projects to life. Like I think about the
15:18
South Prairie Art Show and she had this cool room and we I couldn't make it work to go to the time of the art show when
15:25
these kids were going to do it. So we worked together and we had the kids come in the glow room all by themselves and had this really cool story and just her
15:30
going above and beyond the extra mile that helped me to show off her kids. And then she was also played a huge role in
15:37
that. Um it seemed like just yesterday video with the seniors when they walk through her work helped me make South
15:42
Prairie come alive for that story. So, I just wanted to make sure that they um know how much they represent everybody
15:49
who says yes to helping me, but they uh they deserve uh a lot of praise for for their ability just to say yes and help
15:55
however they can. And that is my presentation. I'm here to answer questions. I love working here. I love
16:02
what I do. I love working with the team that I do. Um but I'm here to answer any questions you might have.
16:11
Maybe just a quick comment and and then a question. You know, four years ago, it's it's kind of
16:17
interesting to look back. We feels like we've come a hundred years just in terms of advancement in the communication
16:23
space and that's really a vision that you you know kind of brought to to the
16:28
district and then did the heavy lifting to make happen. So, just a huge thanks. And then, you know, I think one of the
16:35
things that you've done a fantastic job doing that maybe you didn't touch on quite as much in the presentation is
16:41
giving the public a window into the quiet but really good things that happen
16:47
around the district every day. And I know that every one of those don't get captured, but you have a gift to tell
16:52
stories and and and the way you put those together and talk about the wonderful things going around uh going
16:59
on around DCG uh is really really helpful I think for uh for a lot of
17:05
folks to thanks really have an attachment to to things that they may not otherwise know. So thanks for that.
17:10
Cool. Thank you. Uh the question really is just as you think about the future, you've covered a lot of ground in the last four years.
17:16
Parent Square has been huge. the ability to communicate in different languages and I know we've talked about that a lot
17:22
here at uh in the board meetings, but what do you need from the board uh to continue to support you and what are
17:28
kind of the big rocks if you look maybe even across the next four or five years that you see as important to continue
17:35
down this more effective communication journey that we're on? That that's a a great question. It is
17:42
like it is the question um of h how do we where does where does public school u
17:48
communication land in that like we've talked a lot about uh in this office about it's it is showcasing um what we
17:55
do and the teachers and the people like that that is a living breathing thing that we all should do but also now it's
18:00
probably more aggressive when it comes to saying why what separates DCG from our neighbors what separates DCG from
18:06
their choice so it's you know Bloom's been gracious with when I've brought this to him, he said, "Do it, do it, do
18:13
it." So, I think just the the the thought process to kind of just see me
18:19
push push the envelope because we're not used to to that part of it before. And, you know, I'm willing to because I, you
18:25
know, I believe in the people here. So, we will be you when it comes to the language that we use and and why you're going to pick DCG, it's because we have
18:31
great people. Why are you gonna pick DCG? Because you can move here and and raise a kid here. some of those those um
18:37
DCG creators were picked for a reason because you know we're picking families who have kids here who work here like it
18:43
it it's more of pushing the the create a life here, work here, become here, send
18:49
your preschooler here. Um so just kind of just the what do I need from you?
18:54
just that that's probably just what I what you'll see from me kind of bounces off that idea is is I will be aggressive
19:00
when it comes to the way I spend the money in my budget is is that type of um advertising to to make it attractive to
19:07
young families to choose Grimes and to choose Dallas Center to to live and grow and live and and um to be a part of.
19:16
Thanks for your work on that. Other questions?
19:21
I just would like to say thank you students. You started your presentation
19:28
talking about the impact that your interns have had on you. Yeah. And I think what you do very well is
19:34
showcasing and elevating student stories of success. And so you're just
19:43
Thank you. Appreciate it. Students are a big deal and they do they do fantastic stuff led by teachers. So it's great to
19:49
great way to spend the day. Yes. And obviously I think the teachers are amazing too. Yeah,
19:56
cool. Thank you for saying that. If I can share one thing if unless you've
20:01
got more questions for AJ. Um AJ's a part of the Iowa school public relations association and they have a conference
20:08
every year and for two years I've allowed him to win this battle between us, but next year I don't think he'll
20:13
win. He has been recognized multiple times by his peers for the excellent
20:19
work that he does in communications. And every time he wins these awards, I say,
20:25
"hm, in communications, typically we would celebrate these awards publicly
20:31
and he quickly vetos me." Well, now in year three, I don't think he gets to be that bossy. So, um, just know he's
20:41
we are beyond blessed to have the best in the business and doubly blessed that
20:46
we get his wife to teach and his two girls to be kids of ours because he's as
20:51
good as it gets. So, thanks for all your hard work. You got I'm not telling you anything.
20:59
Thanks, AJ. Thanks, AJ. Dr. Corenza. All right. Good evening, everyone. Nice
21:04
to see all of you. I have it looks like I have a lot but I'll make it quick. I promise. Um the first up is new teacher
21:09
orientation. There's a lot of um you know prior to today which is the culmination of all that hard work new
21:15
teachers and our all staff back to school days. So you can see we welcomed 27 new teachers to the district. Um that
21:22
is in my recollection probably a highlight in for many reasons. One uh
21:28
Mrs. Olson and her team that she has put together just found the right balance of
21:33
not too much content because it can be very overwhelming and just enough to make sure that they feel ready and
21:40
prepared for the first day of school. So, um kudos to her and then it would also include our human resources, um our
21:47
business office, all of the support staff that get people their benefits and their paperwork and their trainings
21:53
completed. And that is considering that they don't really start that process until end of July. That's a heavy lift.
21:59
So, so thank you to them and and their hard work. Um all staff back to school pre-ervice days. I don't know. Um five
22:06
days felt like probably two in my world just because of how much was happening.
22:11
And so you can see there just a detailing of we always try and mix a little bit of building time for staff to
22:18
be able to have the work time they need and they're setting up their classrooms. You'll also see PLC time which is so
22:23
important that idea of collaboration and we know it's a huge focus of our work this year. And then lastly is um then
22:31
our all staff back to school and open houses and things that happened. So really fun to see everyone back at
22:38
school and I think there was a lot of energy at our all staff back to school.
22:43
Questions about those two things? Maybe just a quick one. I know you and Shann's done a lot of work particularly
22:49
in those first handful of days with new teachers and what new teacher orientation could you maybe just take us
22:55
back a couple of years to how much has this evolved and I know you get feedback every year and you can tweak it um some
23:02
every year as well but well I know Shannon would be the first to say that there were already some good systems in place when um Lisa was here
23:09
and and um Mrs. Van Workham and so I think what we tried to do was just continually do some surveys of staff
23:16
like hey how was this experience and I mean to be honest we were new staff ourselves but we get a little bit of
23:23
different orientation when you're administration because you start a little bit earlier but we really honed in she honed in on that feedback from
23:29
the teachers um in fact an example uh of that would be and imagine because it
23:35
involved me talking uh that we actually took away I would present professional development and lane advancements
23:41
one topic a little bit heavier than the other which is lane advancements because there's due dates and things involved. Feedback was we're just not ready for
23:48
that. It's a little too much. We don't have to um you know drone on about that.
23:53
We can get that to them in another way. And so that's probably a perfect feedback example of we care about what
23:59
they experience. We're never going to be perfect because everybody experiences those back to school days differently, but I feel like she's listening to what
24:06
they need. So perfect. Thank you. Um in terms of professional development,
24:13
so here we are off and running. Uh and so we'll have our first um Wednesday early dismissal this this week which
24:19
will be building. That's by design. So those first three days have happened of school. Hey, are there is there any um
24:26
things we need to tweak a little bit, change, do some celebrations, kind of work out the the kinks, and then they'll
24:32
start into their professional development uh content. So things that we shared earlier, I think this summer
24:38
in our professional development plan, they'll start diving in there. Uh the third, we'll have PLC team meetings. I'm
24:44
excited for that. It's the focus. It's the meat of our work this year. So we'll get teams together. Then uh along with
24:50
our PLC teams, our encore, which would be art, music, PE counselors, those groups will meet on their own for some
24:56
uh curriculum and PLC time. and then also our student services. So, ELE, um gifted and talented services, um special
25:04
education, they'll have time to collaborate. Um now, this third, I also want to point out Carrie has done Carrie
25:11
and his team have done a lot of work to adjust and and set up the classified
25:16
staff professional development really well. And Carrie, I don't want to speak for you, but if you want to share what
25:21
you're doing for the third, yeah, for the third, yeah, just uh roles and responsibil
25:29
special staff as well as so I appreciate that because that's back to our efforts to make sure that
25:35
everybody's getting regular training. uh he what I want to point out for him and he wouldn't tell you this himself but he
25:42
worked with a group of classified staff kind of a focus group is what do you need this year so they'll hit the ground
25:47
running so I'm excited about that work and then you can just see we'll start district PD looking at the strong
25:52
framework and PLC's uh in midepptember questions about professional development
25:59
and we'll make sure to share some stories about how it's it's impacting staff and the learning that they're getting uh next is Ed Ed Mento Um so our
26:08
edmentum ed options academy is still um doing well with right now we have about
26:13
I think it's about eight um seats that are taken of the 10. Um we have always
26:19
had had students that move up. We actually don't have any students that are below sixth grade this year. So, um
26:25
it's a good opportunity us for us to continue to build relationships with those families and do whatever outreach
26:31
we can, especially in the upper grades 9 through 12, um where we can help them
26:36
set up for success. Online learning has both pros and cons. When you're if you're self-driven and you're motivated
26:43
and you can complete work like that, works really well. There's other kids who we need to do some check-ins with
26:48
and we'll have the help of the high school um staff to be able to check in with them as well. So, um, right now,
26:54
keep going with that. We have a room to add. So, sometimes we have students whose needs change and we can always add
27:00
them in. We also have a lot of flexibility. So, it doesn't just have to be a full year student. It could be a
27:06
semesterl long uh student. We have options to operate with just one class should the need be. So, I appreciate um
27:13
their flexibility. Question about
27:18
anti-bullying and harassment. So, just a brief update here. We're already getting out with and servicing different groups.
27:25
Uh you can kind of see our timeline where we've done some administrative train training in early August. Um we've
27:31
I was had the pleasure uh we had a couple of people at the seventh grade uh several board members at the at the
27:38
seventh grade uh parent open house and I think it's just our chance to get in front of parents. Um they were very
27:44
great this year. Um ask great questions um whether if not during the presentation but afterwards and just
27:51
allows us to have face with names as we support them. And then we are starting now we've been at North Ridge and we
27:58
will go to uh Dallas Center this week. And the highlight for me is speaking to
28:03
the our activities uh coaches and sponsors so that they also know how to recognize bullying and harassment should
28:09
it happen in their activities. We will have more presentations coming
28:14
up just as staff get comfortable and get settled in and have that professional development. I will say that I know I'm
28:20
a little biased because I think you and Gail are amazing, but I made all of my friends come with us at parent boot camp
28:26
and they all said they loved hearing from you and Gail and a couple of the dads were like, "Actually, she kind of
28:32
seems scary. I don't know if she's going to tolerate much." I'm like, "You're right. She doesn't tolerate anything." So, great feedback from the parents. They
28:38
appreciated the information and just hearing how the school handles it. I a lot of great feedback from parents. So,
28:44
thank you for that. Number one, um we want to be transparent. Yeah, Gail is definitely the tougher of the two of us. Believe me, it's I can say that out
28:50
loud, but I appreciate the support that she provides. Also, um we have to think of it systemically. And probably the
28:57
part that we're most excited of is last year was a chance for us, I think we did third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade,
29:02
sixth grade, seventh, and eighth. And those students move up in the system. They're clear on our expectations. Some
29:10
cases they're aware that we will follow up. We mean what we say. We're going to investigate. I think if we can continue
29:16
to get to second and third graders this year, every year we're going to see results. It just takes a while for us to
29:21
get there, but um we're hoping that we see good results. So, thank you. Um
29:27
state reporting. Boy, this is the least exciting part, but we are all caught up. In fact, actually the nonfall
29:32
supplementary waiting was completed at five o'clock today. So, all of our state reporting is up to date. I want to thank
29:38
Deb Kale. She's worked on some preschool reporting. Um, we have some big things
29:43
that are coming up. We will start with our desk audit, which is just the how do we prove to the state that we're keeping
29:49
up. Uh, they choose different topics every year for us to show. Um, but those will be starting here. And we also have
29:55
some long-term ones like the gifted and talented plan that we will get submitted. So, everything's going very
30:00
well there as well. That's all I've got.
30:05
All right, Dr. Bloom. All right. So, we had three single family homes in Grimes and four town
30:13
home permits for a total of seven. Um, I don't in Dallas Center right now, but we're going to take the number seven
30:18
because last year at this time we had one. So, we will take that. Um, when we
30:24
get to enrollment, a couple things to share. Um, we are as we kind of we're up
30:32
kids from last month. That's a positive. We have we're at negative30 when we talk
30:39
about October 1. So everything right getting compared say it I think I say it every month everything's getting compared to October 1 last year. We're a
30:46
minus 30. So we've we've narrowed that number which is positive. Now unfortunately here's a little bit of the
30:52
grain of salt part. Today we had we had a few more that registered
30:59
another school district. So we roll over every kid that's here, right? like we kind of just automatically register you.
31:06
So, we had a few that then started in another district and today was the first time we heard from that district because
31:13
these kids just showed up. Like we didn't get any records requests from another district like we typically do
31:19
over the summer. So, we had a few of those today. So, that that number is probably going to it has changed as of
31:26
later this this afternoon. Um, but hopefully it's not too much andor we we
31:32
gain some folks between now and our next board meeting, but hopefully progress in the right direction.
31:39
Facilities and construction update. Just want to spend a moment to shout out a couple of people. Um, first is just the
31:48
operations team, building and ground, like our custodial team just works their
31:53
tail off all summer. our kind of maintenance crew, you know, they're out
31:58
fixing some things, just taking care of stuff. Um, heard a lot of nice compliments from principles about how
32:03
what progress was made. Um, and uh, extra shout out to to Travis and Sean
32:09
for the first time in 20 years. Um, we started a school school year fully
32:16
staffed with custodial staff. So, that's a that's a huge win for that department,
32:22
our teachers, kids. They're they're tremendous group. So just neat that we're not, you know, as of today asking
32:29
people to to burn a little extra hours. We we've got the staff we need in the spot. So, uh, that's awesome. So, great
32:36
job out of them. And then specifically when it comes to the bond piece, and I'll be ready, you know, if you've got questions and new business, but we we
32:43
have now kind of AJ and I and and the district team get to kind of be the
32:48
information givers, but we're not going to be the yes vote getters, right? That's for the community folks. So, I
32:54
just want to give a shout out to our community facilities team that met, you know, several times over the over the
33:00
spring and they were the ones knocking on doors the last four to six weeks. So, those 711 signatures all came from
33:08
community folks just donating their time because they believe in in where we're going at DCG. And kind of the the
33:16
leadership team, so to speak, of that team was Julie Quant did some awesome stuff. Kim Prasa and then Matt Austinic
33:22
has been a superstar kind of helping us in Dallas Center. They were at fall festival kind of talking to people and
33:28
coach them up in Dallas Center which was awesome. Like those three have just been a phenomenal team and then everyone else
33:34
that has played their role because you know if this uh measure passes and we get tonight get to put it actually on
33:40
for ballot that team's going to turn into the yes team. we're going to need now door
33:46
knocking from our community to say, "Hey, here's here's why this is a good thing for DCG." So, just thankful for
33:52
that team and AJ's communication and the the team here that's kind of done the work behind the scenes and it's been a a
33:58
great partnership with OPN and DCI as well. Um, ISP convention, just want to
34:03
have that on on people's radar. uh we've got a couple of months, but uh you know, let me know who's interested and I'll
34:10
keep reminding you if you are uh you know, want to want to head out to that that conference on convention to to let
34:17
me know and we'll have Deanna get everybody signed up for the different things they want to do. Um which will be
34:23
a fun time. Always always good learning there. There's your future meeting presentation schedule just so you have
34:29
something to refer back to of so you know who's coming hang out with you. So great to have AJ. and uh new high school
34:35
principal Matt Blackmore is excited to kind of share kind of what he's up to in the high school team and get to know him
34:41
a little bit next month. And last but not least, if you'll let me um share
34:47
just a couple of highlights from today. Um tried to spend a little extra time on
34:52
purpose in building. So, I got the five buildings today to spend uh quite a bit of time in. I'm going to go to Heritage
34:58
and and Northridge and see them tomorrow. But energy was high, the
35:03
teacher excitement, the kids were just, it just seemed like people were in good
35:09
spirits, like good moods that we were, we introduced some new administrator, excuse me, who were just all over the
35:15
place meet and greeting kids, which was great. Again, the buildings look good. Had a little heating and cooling thing
35:21
that we had to figure out. One part of DCE was a little too cold, middle school's a little too hot. So Travis and
35:28
Sean were kind of bouncing back and forth with that, but otherwise it sounds like everything um went well. South
35:34
Prairie, I don't know if you guys know this, but they're doing a project on James Street. I don't know if that's a
35:40
noticed or anything. So Patty Morris and her team had planned really hard the
35:46
last three or so weeks to kind of get the the in and-out structure for parents so kids could be, you know, get in and
35:51
out safely, of course, to their vehicles and get the buses where they need to go. And so we did that uh for the first time
35:57
today. The parents were great. Um so just great job out of that team because there's a little moving and grooving
36:03
there for the first nine weeks. Uh AJ mentioned school to work. We have 40ome kids, 42 I think in school to work this
36:10
year with Mr. Heightland, uh which is great. They're actually going to use this fantastic room as their classroom.
36:17
So like fun for us in this building to have kids kids around. So, they started
36:22
in here today and they'll be here for the first nine weeks until they go out and do their fun internships. But, uh,
36:28
again, it was fun fun to have them and I know I'm forgetting a lot of people and and sorry to do so. But, um, Greg and
36:35
Madison, uh, they're doing great work with bullying. It continues to be a top
36:41
priority. I I hope that's evident from from the work you hear from from our team. But Greg and Madison and and all
36:47
of our coaches, sponsors from from both our fine arts and athletic all in the commons together at the high school last
36:54
week with the priority of we love that we get to give extracurricular opportunities for our kids, but they're
36:59
going to be done in a safe way and we are absolutely going to be part of the group um that make sure kids feel safe
37:06
and welcomed and included and get great experience. So to see all of them in the meeting. So, we had all of our varsity
37:13
coaches, our varsity sponsors, our varsity choir, band, play, musical,
37:18
everybody listening to Greg and Madison was was super cool. And last but not
37:24
least, and then I'll be done. Got a text a little from Jeff Wolf. Everybody dropped off. All the kids accounted for.
37:31
Bus drivers are all coming back tomorrow. So, we'll take that as a as a win. I know it's a little it's quite
37:38
quite the backup. I don't know if anyone is in that in the morning. It was quite the quite the line from here to Grimes
37:44
to Dallas there this morning. So, um, but transportation team again, months and months of getting those schedules
37:51
ready to go, thousands of kids on school buses and pick them up and get them home safe. It's a pretty pretty amazing task
37:57
that we don't take for granted every day. So, shout outs to everybody, but thanks to the teachers, uh, associates,
38:03
counselors, everybody who was amazing to welcome our kids back. It felt felt good to to have them back again. Sir,
38:10
thanks. Thank you, Miss Wmouth. Well, as the rest of the world began its
38:17
new school year today, uh the business office is uh just finishing up last
38:23
year. On Thursday and Friday this week, uh we will have auditors begin the fiscal audit for 2425
38:31
and that will conclude on September 10th and 11th. Uh the timing of this all
38:36
coincides with uh final reports that are due to the department of education on
38:42
September 15th which would include the certified angial financial report, the special education supplement and the
38:48
annual transportation report. So uh while I know it's hard to wait, you'll
38:54
have to wait until the September meeting to hear about all the results out of those reports and the fiscal audit. So
39:00
that's what we're up to. Thank you. Thank you. All right, we'll move along
39:06
to item 10, old business. Uh we've got the second reading of some one and 500
39:13
series policies. Looking for a motion. Move to approve Dickinson.
39:20
Second Lberg. Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I.
39:26
I oppose. Same sign. Motion carries. Item B, uh, call for the 20 25 legislative
39:34
action priorities. Looking for a motion. Move to approve. Dickinson, second Baker Curtis.
39:39
Any discussion? Can I just say something really quick? I just was deciding whether to say this or
39:46
not, but I was really disappointed that only three board members completed this survey. So I just we expect excellence
39:54
from our you know admin staff students and I just don't feel I mean it took 15 20 minutes
40:00
to fill this out. So just I'm a little disappointed that we only had three people fill this out. This is something
40:06
very important. I feel like this is something that drives our priorities um which help our school. So just something
40:12
that keep in mind. I don't know if thing it got missed or I don't know what happened but we've had like a month and
40:17
a halfish to fill this out. So just I I don't know what happened, but I was a
40:23
little disappointed in that three people filled this out. That's less than half. So
40:31
any other discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I
40:37
I post same sign. Motion carries. Moving along to new
40:42
business. Item A, the 2526 TQ committee members looking for a motion.
40:49
Move to approve Baker Curtis. Second, Vanderbald. Any discussion?
40:56
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Oppose. Same sign. Motion carries. Item
41:02

41:08
Move to approve. Wberg. Second. McN. Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I.
41:15
I. Oppos. Same sign. Motion carries. We also have an FFA trip that crosses state
41:21
lines. Looking for a motion. Move to approve. Baker Curtis. Second. Dickinson.
41:27
Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. I.
41:32
Post. Same sign. Motion carries. Item D, resolution
41:38
ordering election on the issuance of the $88 million general obligation school bonds. Dr. Bloom, any additional
41:44
information here? Again, Michelle has done this quite a few times, so she'll keep me in line, but just you know, if
41:51
this passes, this will be our official uh measure to put on um you know, the
41:57
ballot for the election the first week of November. So, this would be the language that we would you know, our
42:03
community again would talk about. we would give information about, but this ultimately would be what our voters are
42:08
voting for if you approve today. Anything else I miss, Michelle? And polls would be open from 7:00 a.m.
42:15
to 8:00 p.m. on November 4th, 2025 for the uh election.
42:21
Thank you. Looking for a motion. Move to approve Dickinson.
42:27
Second, Vanderbeld. Any discussion? Is this something so I know that we've held special elections
42:33
in the past that have cost the district money. Is this something that also costs the district money because it's part of
42:39
like a regular election kind of? Michelle jump. This is when we have to they passed a new law that you can only
42:45
do these now in November. You used to be able to do them a couple times throughout the year. Okay. Now bonds can only be in November.
42:51
Michelle, what what does it cost for So we already have election expense because we have a regular school board
42:56
election. So this would be less costly than if it were a special election all by itself.
43:02
Gotcha. Okay. Thank you. Does that help? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Any other discussion?
43:09
uh you know, aside from, you know, getting the word out, you know, talking to folks about um you know, how, you
43:18
know, certainly the benefit, but then also I think folks are going to have some questions about um you know, the
43:24
the financial or lack thereof in terms of impact on taxes, those types of
43:29
things. What what is it that you need from the board members just in support of this? Is it just kind of word of
43:35
mouth beyond this or are there some other things that we need to be involved in? Yeah, I I think the word of mouth is is
43:41
going to be our best friend. You you all are obviously well connected with folks in the community. So, what you can share
43:48
because you you have a lot of this information, but if there are questions, please please have them, you know,
43:53
again, email us and and we'll get them the facts. I've already got several PTO meetings scheduled that I'll be going to
43:59
speak with. um going to go speak to um the Grimes Democratic um team at the
44:08
excuse me the Grimes Library in October um Rotary Club. I would love to speak to
44:13
any groups, organizations, families, pleased these folks have reached out. I
44:18
said absolutely. So sending those teams my way, but also just kind of helping us
44:24
spread the word. AJ and I now this passes really start the the next level of communication for the next two
44:30
months. So just you know hitting send to to others and just yeah being being a
44:37
little bit of word of mouth on the streets for us. You know I've had a few people ask me some questions about it and I think that
44:42
the the one common theme that comes up apart from you know kind of you know what are what
44:48
are the benefits that the school district's going to you know deliver with the with the funds which you know
44:54
is we we kind of have have done quite a bit of work on that is hey what what
44:59
potentially is the impact from a tax. Yeah. So maybe just give a a couple minutes on that as well if you could.
45:07
So as you know our debt service levy which is the levy that is repayment for
45:12
principal and interest on any bonds that we have or any borrowing the district has done in the past has been at the
45:18
maximum of $45. The board has proactively taken actions
45:24
to have pre-levies and pay down any debt they had, which has freed the board up
45:30
to bond the full 88 million uh should the election pass.
45:37
That levy rate for debt service that is currently at 405 will remain at $45
45:43
whether the election passes or does not pass because the board would in all
45:49
likelihood um pre-levy again to pay off debt if
45:54
this election does not pass at that point in time. So 405 either way we will
46:00
continue that debt service levy at that amount. overall property tax rate has
46:05
several different factors that go into it. That includes how much SSA the legislature gives us, what enrollment
46:12
does, etc. Um, some of those other factors might be our special education deficit, EL deficit, etc. So, that's a
46:20
much more complicated question, but the answer to debt service levy is that is already at maximum and will remain the
46:27
same. Thank you for that. I knew Michelle would nail that. So
46:32
right there are our our community members out and about would relate to me two questions that they would get a lot
46:38
of support which is great. That's one of them or number one and the other two or excuse me the second one is related to
46:44
the auditorium. It's we we need a new auditorium at capacity. So maybe I can say this eloquently enough that you can
46:50
point folks to this video but we had OPN and DCI look into a new auditorium at
46:57
the high school and actually had Oakview to give us some options. A new auditorium at the high school for 900
47:03
seats was $32 million. A 900 seat auditorium attached to Oak View was $28
47:10
million. And when we talked about that and looked at kind of what we had, we're
47:16
$88 million which we're asking for. That's that's towards the top of the price tag. I don't feel like and I I
47:23
believe the community of uh facilities team would would agree, we don't have 32
47:28
million thing worth of things to cross off when it comes to secure entrances, inclusive playgrounds, additions to the
47:35
high school, CTE programming. There's just so many neat things. So, a new
47:42
auditorium is on the horizon. I don't have a date and exact year, but it's
47:47
coming. But in between that, right now the number would be approximately $5
47:53
million that we would put into the existing auditorium to do almost
47:58
everything to make that brand new except put an additional chair there. We still know that's going to be a little bit of
48:05
a headache, but please know this was looked at, thought about, numbers ran,
48:10
and a team ultimately said, "Let's pause. Let's do these other things first." little maybe bigger priority,
48:17
but a new auditorium is on the horizon, but we will definitely put significant dollars into the existing auditorium to
48:24
at least get that to kind of an upgraded place until the the new one uh comes our
48:31
direction. So, those were kind of the big two questions that I would receive. Great.
48:37
Any other discussion? Um, I've had a couple of families reach
48:43
out to me regarding um questions regarding the the parks uh or
48:50
the playground facilities. Sorry, I'm trying to block the light. I'm blinded. It's all right.
48:56
And so I'm not trying to be weird. I just can't see you all. You're like a giant purple dot. Um, and so one of the
49:03
one of the questions that was asked had to do with um opportunities to provide
49:09
feedback regarding the design. You are a godsend. Okay.
49:15
Um, thank you so very much, Nick. Um, feedback about um the design of those
49:21
facilities in order to best meet the needs of some of the students that are there. I also had several um PTO members
49:28
just reach out wanting to know and ask me questions that I think uh obviously I
49:34
referred them to you, but about if they had raised money and had equipment that
49:39
had been installed, would that equipment be preserved? They'd seen some of the amazing updates that had occurred over
49:45
the summer with the work at some of those um schools where they've had, you
49:51
know, failing concrete or um not really great curb cut access and
49:56
seen those improvements and so they're excited and I think that they're wanting to be involved in that process.
50:02
Yep. Great question. Yep. So, I met with Katie last week to kind of talk about PTO funds that are already there maybe that were going to be allocated to some
50:09
more inclusive playgrounds. So, I think they're going to talk to the team about holding on or finding a different route
50:14
because these are coming. Um, optimistic, yes, that things that have been added that are still, you know,
50:20
valuable that are going to be able to stay. I think we're going to get a lot of neat new stuff. Uh, we also have some
50:26
playgrounds that need some just physical attention as well. DCE is an example of
50:31
they kind of have some water issues in part of their playground. So, that's all going to get fixed. So, yes to all that,
50:37
Nancy. The exciting thing is when we see like the the pictures that we've shared out,
50:43
those are as high a level as you possibly can be for all of the things that we're going to have if this bond
50:48
passes. Teams of people will be getting together to meet when we talk about all the updates to the high school. High
50:56
school team are going to be highly involved in that inclusive playground. We're going to need families
51:01
to give us feedback when we talk about. So kind of the feedback loop is about to
51:07
come once, knock on wood, this pass in November. It's not going to just be OPN
51:13
drawing everything on their own. They're going to now start to have those meetings with certain stakeholders based
51:18
on kind of the project they're working on. And so if a parent is interested in getting involved, what's the best and
51:25
the and the bond passes? Yep. Um what's the best way to ensure that
51:30
they're able to participate? Because sometimes I feel parents ask me, well, I would have really liked to have been on
51:36
the committee I never knew. Um, the gentleman from Dallas Center is a great example. He had reached out to me
51:43
specifically about the facilities and I was able to direct him to that committee and he's been an invaluable member to
51:49
that team. And so I just want to make sure that we're capitalizing on
51:54
the amazing community that we have. Yeah. So send Yeah. send any interested person to me but also to kind of
52:01
depending on the project phasing I will share with you and get out to our families you know kind of the folks
52:08
connected to the different projects about here are going to be open Q&A times we're looking for people to sit on
52:15
this committee or u OPM's going to host uh an an evening where folks can come
52:21
give ideas or ask like we'll start getting that out when bond passes and I
52:26
get with OP and DCI on the actual phasing of projects and so they'll start meeting with groups based on those
52:33
phases and then if like I have older neighbors that just moved into the neighborhood
52:39
and so I'm like chatting them up like oh you got to go you know and we know older folks tend to vote with more fidelity.
52:45
Um but they were wanting I was talking about the parent square group. Yeah.
52:51
Is that information going to be sent out again? So, if you're a community member and you're interested in that, I thought
52:56
we had like a parents square.
53:05
Yes, that's what I'm referring to. I'm sorry, I'm a mess. It was the first day of school.
