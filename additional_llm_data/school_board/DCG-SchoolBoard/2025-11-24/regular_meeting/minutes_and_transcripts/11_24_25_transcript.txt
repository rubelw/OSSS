Seeing none, we'll move along to building level reports. Uh transportation director Jeff Wolf's here to present this evening.
21:06
Thank you. Uh we're going to talk about school bus eligibility tonight and um
21:11
we're going to talk about our current policy and we're going to talk about how eligibility will change over the next
21:17
few years given our current policy and we're going to talk and I'm going to give you a preview of our u of a
21:24
recommendation we're going to have to change this policy ne that'll probably come next year. So
21:30
we're not asking for any decisions tonight.
21:37
As I go through this, keep in mind that when I talk about distances, uh we use the road distances and street distances
21:43
and not uh line of sight or sidewalks, uh bike trails and things like that. So,
21:49
we use street distances. Um and also uh safe walking paths is an important
21:56
consideration when we figure out whether uh students are eligible for transportation.
22:04
Let's talk about walk zones first. Um, a walk zone is an area around each school where uh school bus service is not
22:11
available. Um, at the K through four level, that's one mile. Uh, for fifth
22:18
through 8, that's two miles and for the high school, it's three miles. Uh, exceptions to this policy would be if a
22:25
student is uh has a disability and and transportation is required. uh we would
22:32
transport that child wherever they live. Um and then also if exception would be
22:38
if there's no safe walking paths from home to school or school to home then that would be an exception to the walk
22:44
zone. Uh next zone is the pay zone. Uh this is an area where school bus service is
22:51
available for a fee. Uh and that's only available right now from K through
22:56
fourth grade. And uh it's it's for kids that live one to two miles from their
23:01
school. Uh it's all we also make that available to child care providers that have more than 10 kids in their that
23:08
need transportation. Um a little bit more about the pay to ride service is we introduced this back
23:14
in 2019. Some of you might remember that uh we evaluate the fee annually to make
23:20
sure it covers costs and we currently have three dedicated uh buses supporting
23:25
pay to ride supporting 205 families.
23:31
Then the last zone is um is free zone and that's the area that we provide free transportation to kids
23:38
and for K through eight that would be 2 miles and above and for high school it's
23:44
three miles and then the exception for that again is uh if there's no safe walking paths that
23:50
will affect uh whether affect the free zone policy. So, for example, high
23:57
school in Oak View, when those buildings were built, uh there's no walking paths to those buildings. So, everybody in
24:03
those buildings are eligible for free service.
24:09
Uh looking at current ridership, um we currently have 205 kids that we
24:15
transport in the pay zone and then we have 1,485 kids in the the free zone
24:21
that we transport. One of the biggest questions I get and some of you as have asked this, what happens when um
24:29
development from Grimes reaches those buildings? How does that affect eligibility? Um now just given current numbers,
24:36
current um current riders, if that were to happen now, uh 150 Oak
24:46
View kids would move from the free zone to the pay zone. excuse me, the from the
24:51
free zone to walk zone. So 150 kids would um would lose their
24:57
busing. Uh also at the high school it once develop development reaches the
25:03
high school 190 kids would move to the walk zone.
25:13
So on a map what that looks like um for Oak View, Oak View is in the lower left
25:18
corner of this map. Um that first shaded area would be the walk zone.
25:25
Um and then the second,
25:30
excuse me, the the first two areas would all the way up would be um would be your
25:35
walk zone. So that would cover that would go from uh Southeast Main Street
25:41
and Arca all the way up to Northwest 8 would be your walk zone. And again, that affect about 150 kids. Um that's 150
25:50
more kids, cars going to Oak View, creating some congestion. On the plus
25:55
side, that would uh we would eliminate three routes and that would save us about $150,000 per year if we under
26:02
current policy for the high school. Under current
26:08
policy, um once development reaches the high school, the three-mile walk zone
26:14
would would be implemented and you'd basically lose all busing from Grimes to the high school. The only area that
26:21
would get service would be the far northeast corner which is north and east
26:26
of Heritage Elementary. Uh when I shared this with the high school, they felt that uh the 190 kids
26:34
losing busing would would have a negative impact on attendance and their ability to get to school.
26:42
So, we're looking at another idea. Um, uh, the idea that you will present next
26:49
year to you, but I want just want to give you a preview of it. Um, and that would be to do what to take
26:56
what we're doing at the elementary school level and apply it to every building. So, every building would have
27:02
a onem walk zone, one to two mile pay zone, and a two plus
27:07
mile free zone. So, we'd mimic what we're doing at the elementary school.
27:15
And again, I just want to stress that this it's going to take two, three, four years before development fully reaches
27:22
the the high school in Oak View. So, any any changes won't affect
27:27
families for a few few years. So, what that looks like at Oak View
27:33
under that proposed policy proposal, um,
27:39
again, Oak View is in the lower left corner. Uh, a walk zone would cover most of the southwest section of Grimes and
27:46
there would be a pay zone in the middle and then the red Z, the red area would be all the kids that continue to get
27:53
free service. And under this idea, we would still be be cutting about one route
28:02
for the high school. Again, they'd have a onem walk zone. Um, and then there would be a pay zone
28:09
in the middle and then the free zone is is would be in the red. About 40 40 to
28:14
50 kids would would uh be in the walk zone in this scenario.
28:21
Okay. So that's uh that's the idea we're working with right now. The idea we
28:27
present next year might be this. It might be something slightly different. So that's kind of what we're looking at.
28:35
So I would be open to any feedback you might have or any questions you have regarding
28:41
this or any other transportation type issue. Do you know like rough rough estimate
28:48
here? Um how many kids come from Dallas Center for Oak and for the high school?
28:54
Uh about 50 for Oakview and another 50 for high school. So in the event that like
29:02
those routes like if policy stayed the same, right, and then those high school and Oak View buses or whatever went
29:08
away, those three three buses went away, um what kind of impact would that in
29:14
theory have to get those approximately 100 kids from Dallas Center to Oak View
29:20
into the high school? I'm not following the question. So when you said like if policy stayed
29:26
the same, you would eventually eliminate three Three routes from Grimes Grimes to
29:31
the So just in Grimes just Grimes to those kids. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Everybody in Dallas Center is more than
29:37
three miles more than two miles. So they would always get free transportation. So those lines aren't just those are the
29:44
lines that are in Grimes that get you to those buildings. I apologize. Once there's development around Grimes
29:49
around the high school, it would be a more of a circle. Okay. But but yeah, Dallas Center will always get
29:56
free service to high school and to Oak View. Perfect. Thank you. And eventually maybe even to the middle
30:01
school in DC Elementary as as it grows, right?
30:07
And is I'm sorry. After you, Nancy, please. I was just wondering this walking path
30:13
that they've created here now. Yes. That's currently kind of exempt from our policy at this time. Is that correct? Or
30:20
can you clarify this walking path constitute a safe walking path? I think
30:25
that people see development on this side of town and wonder those questions.
30:31
Well, once eventually that will be a good walking path, but as we saw this fall, it was broke up for two and a half
30:38
months. So, we want to make sure all the development is done. So, it's a stable walk path and not
30:44
something that's going to get broke up every once in a while when development is done. So,
30:49
Nancy, I like your question when you when you phrase it exempt. Jeff and I talked, could we have used it? Sure, but
30:55
exempt is the right word. We do not need to be using that one walking path because how were again how
31:01
were kids from the south side of Grimes going to get across? So, we just essentially ignored that sidewalk
31:07
when it came to any miles for bus service. And we have construction that's pretty
31:12
major construction that's going to be going on in that area. Correct. For a while. Yep. And so I just I know that some of
31:20
the paths get flooded or they get driven over making them less safe. And so
31:26
I just think as a parent that's what Yep. Yeah. Jeff, how do you think about
31:33
needing to cross Highway 44 and have I understand how development could reach
31:38
the school, but knowing what the speed limit is on Highway 44, the volume of traffic, the
31:45
lack of uh pedestrian controls, and then as a parent probably thinking
31:51
about the level of comfort of, you know, a kid whether they're in seventh or
31:57
eighth grade or high school needing to cross Highway 44 on a regular basis. pieces.
32:02
It's actually in our policy that at least we don't allow kids to cross Highway 44 or 169. Um
32:11
but um I think eventually Brookside would be a good place where kids could
32:17
cross at the high probably the high school level. I don't think we'd want elementary school kids ever crossing
32:23
that without a crossing guard. Um but that that's the kind of things we look at every spring when we we look at walk
32:30
zones for the next year. We look at what is a safe place to cross the street. Um
32:36
there was a time back in the you know 90s where we we had um only only
32:45
elementary school we had in Grimes was South Prairie and kids from the north side would walk would cross 44.
32:52
My kids did that. Um so It's not I I think there needs this just needs to be
32:58
a safe situation. I mean, I don't think County Line Road we want we'd want kids crossing at that point yet. Eventually,
33:06
maybe when the speed comes down and but yeah, all those things we we look at
33:11
every year and um me and me and the superintendent would would look at that and look at changes.
33:18
Um it might be a situation where we want the school board to approve walk zones.
33:24
at some point down the road. Um,
33:29
thank you. I have a question not pertaining to this, but I know we put software in, right, a couple years to do the bus
33:35
routes. Is that how how is that going? Is that It's going great. Okay. Yeah. Makes us much more efficient. We
33:41
have much better idea of um of what our we're tracking kids. We can a new
33:48
student comes on board. we can email the parent schedule the next day. It's just
33:54
it's really good. And uh probably next year I'll be looking at um recommending the next level of
34:01
technology for And what is that? That would be a tablet on every bus.
34:06
Okay. A kid as kids get on they would scan in and out so we can really keep track of
34:11
attendance. Um what I really like about it is their picture would pop up on the screen. So
34:19
the bus driver can learn names quicker. Um GPS would be part of that. Uh really
34:26
cool thing is a parent could on their phone see where their bus is at. We already kind of
34:32
We're starting to button. We're starting to see that more and you know when you order Uber Eats or
34:39
whatever you can see where your food's coming. Why can't you see where your bus is at? So the newer the younger parents are kind
34:45
of expecting that. So, thank you.
34:51
Any other questions? I just want to share for this team. I I think you all know that there's Jeff is
34:57
the best in the business. I go and I get to have, you know, some of these meetings and truly when transportation
35:03
is talked about, they we kind of have the the leader in in the state with Jeff. He's he's phenomenal. He's driving
35:12
bus routes here and there. He takes as good care of his people as any person in
35:17
our in our district. They just love working for him and that's I mean he's he's as big of a reason why anyone stays
35:23
in that role. So thanks for everything you're doing and you know he and I have talked a lot about this and and the gist
35:29
of why we still want to bring this to you guys is we are not looking for ways to keep kids off the bus. In fact, we're
35:36
going to talk about the law says we could do this, but we'd
35:42
ra really like to stay on top of keeping as many as we can on the bus and being
35:47
responsible to highways and get so the conversations are not in any way to be
35:52
honest about saving a bunch of money right now. It's safety and we want kids on the bus because we know they go to
35:57
school more, those things. So, it's it's neat to have those kind of highlevel conversations with Jeff. uh he he gets
36:04
kind of the whole picture. So, thanks for everything you do. Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you,
36:10
Dr. Krenza. All right. Good evening. We have a couple of updates. First, I'll start with state reporting. Um just a couple I
36:16
want to bring your attention to. We're still working on the desk audits, which are just our documentation that we're
36:22
meeting with accreditation standards and state laws and work with that. Um this
36:27
year's pre uh kindergarten through grade 12 desk audit was quite a bit more lengthy. So we're just waiting on some
36:33
policy updates uh that we're checking that were already taken care of today. Our IDA um part B desk audit which looks
36:41
at the performance of our students with disabilities um that was actually signed off by Dr. Bloom yesterday. So that is
36:47
complete. We'll work on our preschool desk audit. Um so right now everything's going well there and just completing and
36:53
finalizing any sort of uploads that we need to. So that's underway. Professional development you can see
37:00
here um the November PD sessions. I want to highlight um that this month really
37:05
was by design. We structured it to give more building time in a row. So we do
37:11
some districts in the flex days probably happened more in the fall as we got underway November with parent teacher
37:17
conferences. one of those Wednesdays. K8 is for or TK8 is for parent teacher conferences. Um, but I know our
37:23
buildings enjoy that time to work with their staff on what they're doing. So, um, that's gone well. I'm sure Dr. Bloom
37:29
will provide an update at some point on safety trainings, but those continue on and, um, thankful for everyone involved
37:35
in those questions about state reporting or PD. Those are both pretty standard. Um, and
37:41
just a little bit about teacher quality. So, as you know, we do have a teacher quality committee that meets met in September. Um, we end up having to
37:48
cancel our October meeting due to quite a few absences, but we're back in November. The focus of that group is
37:54
really working on two things. That's a review of our implementation of district level PD, which is the strong
38:00
instructional framework and our evaluation process. And then also they will take on a few other smaller tasks
38:06
like looking at the calendar, which is actually going to happen next month. will start to roll out the 26 27
38:12
calendar to that group. Um, we've been really focused on the strong framework and how do we start to incorporate that
38:18
into our teacher evaluation system. By state law, we have to report out on the eight Iowa teaching standards if a
38:24
teacher met or um did not meet those eight standards. And that's always been, of course, that's state code, but that's
38:31
good practice for us. purpose of strong framework. The adoption of the strong framework was to give us the ability to
38:38
have more targeted connect uh conversations and connections with teachers around what makes for a highly
38:44
effective classroom teacher. And so um finding ways to incorporate that into
38:49
the evaluation system, giving teachers feedback is the work of the TQ committee. We basically come up with uh
38:57
last session was a brainstorming of what are all the ways that we could incorporate a teacher framework. Um
39:02
December we'll really bring forth a proposal um couple of ideas that the group can talk through and um then we'll
39:09
continue that work where we you know what does it look like for a teacher going through the evaluation process. How does that differ if you're a first
39:16
year brand new to the profession teacher? How would that look different if you were a second year new to the
39:21
profession but about ready to sign off on lure? And then what if you were a career teacher someone who's been here
39:27
many many years. Um, and then lastly, if you're a career teacher that's new to DCG, meaning you've taught somewhere
39:33
else and you came here for the first year. So, there's a lot of different variations. So, for that committee, it's
39:39
a lot of good conversation. I'm thankful for their input. Um, so just watch for more to be coming on that, but I like to
39:44
keep people updated. Um, the last one is uh ESSA. So, you're
39:51
familiar with the Iowa school performance profiles as we've done some learning. As you know, those came out in
39:56
the gosh, it was almost like end of September, early October. And we still had one school in our district that was
40:01
received the targeted status. Um, and it was for the subgroup of students with disabilities. So, we still were below um
40:08
in the lowest 5% of scores for students with disabilities at at Oakview. Um,
40:14
thus what they did is in the past last year schools with Oakview when they were
40:20
on the targeted status last year, we still did a review of their building goals. What action steps were they
40:26
taking? We did that in district. The state has changed that this year requiring all schools, not just those
40:33
with a title one status to undergo the ESSA and it's called SAMI process, the self assessment of MTSS practices. So
40:41
together we've done a resource allocation review with the team. We've looked at a data review just how are we
40:47
doing based on the data presented in the Iowa school performance profile just for OP. And we've done the SAMI and they're
40:54
finishing up with their action planning steps. They will enter that as a building into CASSA into the uh
41:00
consolidated application and accountability system and then that goes to the state for approval by the person
41:06
that oversees our region and then we continue to engage in just ongoing conversations and check-ins around their
41:12
progress. I want to share um I was able to facilitate that meeting as a
41:18
facilitator of the SAMI uh and that team did an excellent job. So, this would be
41:23
the ESSA team at Oakview. Might be different than their building leadership team, but for it was last it was held um
41:29
a week ago today and that team was engaged the entire time. I'm I'm proud
41:34
of them. They took a critical look at, hey, what are we doing now that we can celebrate? What is the data telling us
41:40
that we need to improve? And it's pretty vulnerable to put yourself out there as a staff. when you're in it every day,
41:46
you know you're working hard to be able to examine, hey, what about our practices might we want to continue to
41:51
improve upon? So, they're in the final stages of that. That's due December 5th.
41:56
Um, but I think it's important to acknowledge their work. Um, as our other buildings don't engage in that because
42:02
they don't have a targeted status. Um, but we realize it is a thorough process by which they look at their practices.
42:08
So, um, we've been busy doing that in the school improvement department and questions around ESSA or any of those.
42:15
Um, I do I correct me if I'm wrong. ESSA is also um based off school performance
42:23
profile. Correct. Yes. Correct. Um can you talk a little bit about some of the things that I'm
42:30
I'm reading um and some of the literature coming from
42:35
say ISA regarding changes to um using
42:40
low income or SNAP with school performance profiles.
42:47
I have seen just very little about that. Um my what I have seen is maybe asking
42:55
the question of when we look at the state's performance the schools in the state and say I forget the number 1300
43:02
schools like is there a connection between stool school schools that are scoring in a receiving a targeted or
43:07
comprehensive status and their free and reduced uh counts and right now as we've
43:13
met as a board in that work session um they are not changing from that scoring
43:18
system. So, um, could that be a could there be a correlation? I have my own private thoughts to that or, you know,
43:25
things professionally. Are they is the state looking at changing that? I have not heard anything related to any sort
43:31
of considerations that they would make. I think those points are valid for schools to ask. It's interesting when
43:37
you see the data of the schools um that are probably score the lowest on the school performance profile with people
43:44
wondering is there a correlation to those would also be schools with high low SCES um status um overall but uh I I
43:54
don't have enough information to answer your question successfully but I do know the state has not has not I think
43:59
they've worked hard to develop their profile right wrong or indifferent um I don't know how they would account for
44:06
Thank you. Yeah, Nancy, I'm with Greg real quick. I' I've seen like we should be talking about
44:12
this kind of as a as a public school, but not in response to something's
44:18
coming from the state. More of a maybe you state should be looking at these numbers as well. um part of our team
44:24
will be a part of a webinar with the department of ed next week because they are going to talk to us and then make
44:30
public um the roll out of a district performance profile. So right now these
44:36
profiles are kind of building specific. They are going to be sharing with us next week and then the public the week
44:42
after their formula for a district-wide profile and what that means and how it
44:48
works. So um curious to see what that's all about and share more.
44:53
Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Any other questions for Dr. Krenza,
45:01
Dr. Bloom? All right. So, starting with building permits, you know, what do we have? Nine or so up until this point this fiscal
45:07
year, now 12 in October. So, that's good news. 10 residential uh home permits and grimes, two in Dallas Center. So, we'll
45:14
keep that number on the rise. Exciting stuff. Now, for some rough news. um down
45:22
34 students this month from certifying in October 1st to now where we stand as
45:30
of the board packings out 35. And you can kind of see the breakdown. What just
45:35
has us puzzled in this office is as you know right now they're they're not
45:42
leaving for open enrollment, right? You can't just do I want to go to this other school. You literally are moving
45:49
your house. And I think I've said that a lot. You're moving your family and you can see which ones are kind of around us
45:54
across the state. So these kind of just added up over the last couple of weeks. So then last week when Deanna and I sit
46:01
down and go over all this stuff, I said, Diana, when they're calling you and turning, what are they saying? Like are
46:08
please please do never hesitate if they've got we're moving because this is awful. And she's like they they're just
46:15
moving. I don't I don't have a negative experience they're sharing with me. I don't have a Do you want to talk to
46:22
Bloom about it? They're just moving. She says they're pleasant conversations. They're all So again, we don't want to
46:29
get into people's private life about why is it anything related to prices or
46:35
opportunities? We don't know. But not good that we're down. But at the same time, it's a little hard for us to grab
46:41
because they're not, again, o open enrollment is not a thing right now. So, they're they're literally moving to
46:47
another school district where by law they they should go. That being
46:53
said, to be fair, if it's local, we are we are certainly telling them if you
46:58
want, you can open and roll back, right? That's an option. Depending on where it is, that's certainly a possibility. A
47:06
quick challenge though, right, is when you open enroll, you don't get transportation. So sometimes that's a barrier. We can't we can't go into
47:13
another school district to bring in even when you open enroll. So that for for
47:19
plenty of people, right, unless you have a high school kid, like kind of becomes at times a non-discussion point. Um, but
47:27
anyway, I I wish I had better information of why. I I just talking with Diana there there's not there's not
47:33
a bunch of bullets of this is why we're leaving and you could do something about it. They're they're moving their
47:38
families. So unfortunate, but we'll keep you posted on that.
47:43
Okay. Uh several things on facilities. First and foremost, uh haven't we haven't been together in person since
47:49
the bond passed. So just want to say thank you for all your support and answering questions and you again
47:54
supporting our work as a as an admin team and as a district. We couldn't have done it without without each one of you
48:00
at the board table supporting it. So, thank you. Thank you. Exciting stuff. You probably saw we we did pretty well
48:06
across the metro and the state. The support for DCG from our families is
48:11
really really high. So, that's exciting. Just over the last couple weeks, OPN, the architects have met with uh
48:18
representatives of the high school team. So, they kind of started an initial what do you like, what do you don't like. um
48:24
kind of kind of did some of that on science spaces, activity spaces, room spaces, library. Uh they talked to the
48:30
cafeteria staff, the custodial team. They kind of just met with a whole bunch of people over the course of two days,
48:36
admin team, admin assistants um to start that kind of listening process. They
48:42
also did that separately with uh high school activities folks. So, not Oakview
48:48
yet, but they did high school um activities to kind of get get their input on on some of the the stadium
48:54
work. So, those meetings are are um fast and furious. They will then um uh Travis
49:04
Donahghue and Sean Shadow meet with the admin team tomorrow to talk about the timeline to start off for a couple of
49:10
our inclusive playground projects. They will start that conversation at the admin table about what are you looking
49:16
for, what do you need, and then that will go out to families um for a survey.
49:22
AJ, will you remind me when our families are getting kind of the first playground survey? Sunday. Sunday.
49:27
Sunday. Yep. So, they'll get that and then that will morph into a little deeper dive into exclusive playground
49:34
specifically. So, we're making sure we get the the voices at the table, but we are going to see,
49:40
knock on wood, a couple of inclusive playgrounds be ready darn close to the
49:45
start of the school year. Going to focus on DCE first and Northridge. They have
49:51
other projects that are taking place over the summer with their heat pumps and fire panels and getting some new
49:57
audio equipment in there. Let's just do it all at the same time. So, we'll start with those two, but it will not be far
50:05
behind that South Prairie uh heritage and the middle school. Um, just as kind
50:11
of a a word of caution, maybe what we're going to do with each building is kind of do an inventory
50:17
of the actual playgrounds that are there, what are we missing, what do we need, and then go out and do it. So, a
50:24
place, to be honest, like DCE got some pretty old equipment. Some of that stuff probably needs to go. They're going to
50:30
get more inclusive playground because a place like Heritage that has had it for
50:37
like they're not going to get as much playground equipment. But we're really going to try to do is be as darn
50:43
equitable as possible with what the items are there. So if you get if you go to DCE or Heritage, you're going to get
50:50
similar playground equipment, both regular, so to speak, and inclusive. and what's
50:57
coming for everybody, right, is is certainly the the softer, safer, more accessible ground. Um, all that. So,
51:04
it's going to be exciting, but that's that's going to happen pretty quickly. Um, also, I got the from OPN last week.
51:10
I got kind of the first draft. I'll be very cautious of our construction management crew, DCI, got that as well,
51:16
so they're going to put their input on it, but we got the first draft of like a timeline. So, this is when we know we
51:22
think we can get some inclusive playgrounds going next summer. We know the high school project that's not going
51:27
to start digging probably until later fall next year because of schematic design and all the bidding process and
51:34
the paperwork. So that's going to be a longer deal. But springtime summer, we're going to start to see some
51:40
projects including playgrounds, the the the entry, right, the safety and security at those couple buildings. So
51:47
um every month now you'll get a constant update uh from me on the work from OPN DCI and just facilities in general. Um,
51:56
and two last things related to that. So, we will have Shaylee and Monica will be
52:02
joining us along with um some members of the high school team and admin team and and OPN. We're going to go to Kansas
52:08
City on the 15th and 16th. So, one day overnight and we're going to get to spend time at six different high
52:15
schools. Uh, several of which are similar to the you've renovated an
52:22
existing building, right? We're not just gonna you have a brand new high school. Great. Like that may be helpful for some
52:28
parts, but there's a several on purpose that have have very large renovating a
52:35
high school project. So, some will see the whole thing. Others we may be just focused on CTE spaces, right? Others we
52:42
may be just focused on science classrooms. I think there's going to be a lot everywhere. Um, but that's going
52:48
to be exciting to take a bunch of notes and just kind of see what's out there. And then lastly with facilities, Greg
52:54
and I spent Friday of last week and today uh Friday we were at North Pulk
52:59
Ankeny Centennial Walke and West De Moine touring their CTE spaces and today
53:06
was DMAC. Um we were in their construction trades program, their culinary arts program and the automotive
53:14
tech which is I mean they're just insanely cool. And then uh later this
53:19
morning we were at DMAC I'm excuse me uh de mo central campus looking at their
53:25
program and a lot of what Greg and I were after was we're not trying to reinvent the wheel.
53:31
We're not going to run a marine biology program at DCG. Central Campus does a great job of that aviation
53:38
but are there some programs that may be better for DCG to host or really what
53:44
the last two days were was kind of looking at facilities. So, we were talking to teachers, principals,
53:50
uh what what do you love about this space and what maybe could be done differently? So, we took as much like
53:56
don't do that notes as we did like wow that's incredible. We're blessed that
54:02
all those people were letting us walk around. They they gave us hours of time. So, we are grateful for those districts
54:08
and partners. But we've got, I bet, double digits of notes on just little
54:14
things. We saw, feedback from them, cool things. So, we're excited to do that with Kansas City and give that to OPN
54:21
and say, "Good luck. We are ready for you to do this list for us." So, really
54:26
neat. So, excited about where that's going. So, any questions on the facilities bond in general? I know I
54:33
kind of just rattled off a bunch. I do have a question. I know that the
54:39
CTE is really about getting out and having that um employability.
54:44
I'm just wondering um is there any part of this scope of work that includes
54:52
thinking about how that can also be used to support our 4 plus programming here at our building?
54:59
Yeah, that's a great question because because Nancy to the bond specifically, we're going to do some neat things on
55:04
the high school campus for four plus program. We we want to build right kind
55:09
of that apartment complex feel. I just tour Johnston. Okay. And that's So this is why I'm asking
55:14
that's on our our list to do. We've heard some really neat places that are doing that. So I would say yes, there's
55:21
kind of that piece as part of it from a
55:26
CTE4 plus connecting with our employability partners like we haven't had that conversation. Go ahead. Well,
55:33
we haven't formally, but our decap team is where most of that works. So, CTE is
55:38
such a narrow and tiny scope of what we would call postsecary readiness. So,
55:44
post-secondary readiness is this big. Then you get into probably like work-based learning and industry
55:50
recognized, then you get into CTE. So, that it it narrows as you go. We have talked in our DECAP, which is our career
55:57
and academic plan, about where can we start to think about students with disabilities. That was feedback that the
56:02
board gave us at one of our earlier presentations and so we've started to talk about what that might look like and
56:08
where are those opportunities that exist. So it's on our radar. We probably made more progress than typical with
56:14
that. So as we think about making workplace work workbased learning
56:20
opportunities in the workplace um you know are there opportunities and companies that we could partner with
56:26
even like I know TripleB's Diner in Johnston um you know provide support for students with disabilities anywhere here
56:32
in our in our district area that we could partner um we're starting to reach out more than ever to businesses so it's
56:39
coming probably a little bit slowly because it is so giant um but I think those are all great questions and we
56:44
take that feedback back back to those groups. And correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't also like Voke Rehab and transition
56:51
services had legislation I believe last year to prioritize Yes. And we met our DECAP, I was the rep
56:59
for DECAP with the vocational rep um person that worked here with DCG. So, we
57:04
met earlier like in September, early September to sign off on that process. So, um we've got those pieces in place.
57:12
We're just working to kind of grow that. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. Any other facilities stuff I can
57:18
help with? Okay. All right. And lastly, I just wanted to bring your attention to a a
57:25
TIFF project in in Dallas Center. So, TI tiff is a tax increment financing. Cities do this frequently is probably
57:32
the wrong word, but it's it's fairly common. We get it from Grimes, Dallas Center, even Urbandale can do it with a
57:38
little sliver of Urbandale city. That's Grimes. And that's when cities are essentially kind of taxing the school
57:44
district back for projects that they would argue are bringing increased
57:49
valuation to the district. Okay, it happens. School districts don't love it,
57:54
of course, but it's it's part of the deal. We have good relationships with everybody. Fine. The reason I bring this
58:00
one up in particular is because I ended up deciding to speak at the Dallas Center City Council meeting last week
58:07
and it and it really revolves around two items. I just want it on the board attentions if you've got questions or or
58:14
see this. So, Dallas Center is going to do an urban renewal project. Okay. They're going to I think kind of revamp
58:20
their desire to kind of I don't know refresh or outlook kind of the downtown
58:26
part, which is which is neat. I think they're going to they want to try to build a road or two that that does some
58:31
connecting to potential residential areas. um and and just revitalize with
58:38
the goal, right, of getting to um folks moving down center. Great. We of course are all support of that. Been a great
58:44
team. I I will tell you the the major concern that I shared about the TIFF
58:50
project itself is I'm going to I'm going to throw Michelle under as my teammate
58:56
under the butt like she's been around a long time and hasn't seen this and so this was new to me. So I started with her. The Dallas Center city
59:03
administrator with approval by the city council is tiffing one quarter of his
59:08
salary. So I went to speak and say, "Hey, like
59:13
projects are one thing. Like we get it. You're now going to be asking Grimes and
59:20
Dallas Center citizens of the school district to pay 25% of the city
59:25
administrator of Dallas Center salary for just under $30,000." And we just have a huge problem with the
59:33
district, in this case, our tax citizens, paying for another city officials
59:40
salary, even part of it. A, that's kind of what your job is and how the Dallas
59:46
Center city pays for you. B, you're again, you're asking citizens of
59:52
Grimes who don't live in Dallas Center to pay for part of that. That was the argument that I was making about why we
59:59
we we aren't arguing as much about the project. It's about the salary piece.
1:00:04
Okay. So, that was half of it I want to share very uh transparently with you
1:00:09
because I did with them. The other half was the timing piece. So, as part of TIFF projects, you have to give a school
1:00:16
district an opportunity to have essentially a consultation period. Hey, school district, we're going to tiff
1:00:22
some some tax back. You have the opportunity to sit and ask questions. Awesome.
1:00:30
We got their tiff proposal on Tuesday, November 4th in the afternoon, and their
1:00:36
consultation period was noon on November 5th, the next day. I happen to be out of
1:00:42
the state, so by the time I get it, we're gone. That's actually why I ended up at the city council meeting was
1:00:48
because I didn't have an opportunity. So, I shared a little frustration with that. John Cook and I have had a good
1:00:55
relationship, the city administrator. John and I met a month ago to talk about this project. I appreciate him showing
1:01:01
me Dallas Center stuff. It's It's exciting. But nowhere did John tell me that part of what they were going to tiff was a quarter of his salary. So, I
1:01:08
shared my frustration that we're paying for that. And I just didn't like that we
1:01:14
met and you didn't tell me and then you gave us less than 24 hours to talk to you about it. And so it was just a
1:01:20
little bit of a bummer. So I spoke the board or excuse me the city council took
1:01:26
up the action. Did not have any discussion on it. They just voted unanimously. So FYI that
1:01:32
happened and so we will be paying for their, you know, portion of of the
1:01:37
project and his salary. And it I just I just wanted this board
1:01:44
to know that that that happened. Part of my
1:01:50
um hopefully professional frustration was that's $30,000 that could go
1:01:56
somewhere else when we've talked about staffing. Um but it is what it is. We're
1:02:03
moving on. Um but I just wanted that I want you aware I did talk to to the
1:02:08
Dallas City City Council and that is a little bit of the context of why I was there. I'm certainly not looking for
1:02:15
ways to go to city council meetings, but I thought that was important enough one to share just it was a unique enough
1:02:22
TIFF project, the salary piece that I just wanted DCG's voice to be heard in
1:02:29
front of the Dallas Center City Council. So, um, with that, I'll I'll do my best to answer any of your questions, but I
1:02:35
just I wanted that to be on your radar if you got any
1:02:41
questions. So, Grimes, we have TIFF and Grimes as
1:02:48
well. Um, do we have a sense of just TIFF
1:02:53
overall at the district level, what that that costs on an annual basis? And that's really an unfair question to hit
1:02:59
you cold with. And if you need to get back to us, that's fine. But knowing you, you might have So, let me do my best. Um, because we
1:03:07
asked the same question. There are already existing tiffs, some of them years old that are working through their
1:03:14
lifetime. Um, some recently renewed, but
1:03:19
did not have a uh single document that could tell me what they all were. And so
1:03:25
I reached out to Piper Jaffrey who works with many of the municipalities and asked them could you compile just from
1:03:32
public data and explain to us what tiffs are in place, what they cover encompass
1:03:37
what those projects are so that we have one an idea of what those things are and
1:03:44
two what the impact is to the total tax rate of the district. And so as Dr.
1:03:51
Bloom says, "We're paying for that." The mechanics of an actual tiff is much more
1:03:57
complex than that. We don't write them a check. Instead, what happens is a
1:04:02
redistribution uh because valuation from an area in the
1:04:08
tiff is not allowed to grow. That growth goes to the city and our tax rate is
1:04:13
split over a smaller valuation because that growth is attributed somewhere
1:04:18
else. And so it does probably drive up our tax rate, our mill rate to everyone
1:04:25
within the boundaries of the school district. So let's say this one might have been a couple of cents on the levy
1:04:33
uh overall paid by all taxpayers of the district. So when you have a tiff that
1:04:38
covers a let's say a city street in grimes but that valuation it's part of
1:04:45
the tiff that valuation mill rate is applied across all the citizens of the
1:04:51
school district and so it might be someone in Dallas center is paying for a project in grimes and or vice versa
1:04:57
depending on what they are. Dr. Dr. Bloom and I felt like it was well worth uh the cost
1:05:03
um to have Piper investigate for us exactly what's out there. Do any of the
1:05:09
others have salary and benefits in them that we don't know about or is it just this one from the city of Dallas center
1:05:14
that uh came to light in this process? So more on that to come for you.
1:05:22
Yeah. Well, and I I you know, I think you know, the district's worked hard to
1:05:27
build strong relationships with both Dallas Center and Grimes, and I think that's important. I would hope that,
1:05:34
you know, if we're meeting with them, there would be better transparency around what's going to go on the tiff.
1:05:40
Hey, this is coming, get us the right notice period. I mean, all of those things seem to be just
1:05:46
what you would expect to have happen, but it would be good to understand more comprehensively what the tiff impact
1:05:53
just broadly to the district is, where it comes from, and then that salary benefits question was going to be my
1:05:59
second one. So, great. Could I inquire as to how much the Piper Jeffrey uh work was?
1:06:06
So, I am awaiting that quote. I have just requested it. So, I don't have a number for you yet, Meg, but I can get
1:06:12
that to you. Okay, thank you. Um, just devil's advocate hat because it's
1:06:18
my favorite hat. Um, in so far as like offering a certain amount of time, I
1:06:23
know that that's something that we have discussed too as far as like the 24-hour notice and we published it where we
1:06:30
needed to publish it and then if that wasn't you know if you didn't seek out where it was then you know reasons x y
1:06:35
and z. We have absolutely fielded those questions and had those conversations at this table. So, um, I feel like I I
1:06:43
would hope I would hope that the City of Dallas Center did everything that was legally required of them, that they did
1:06:49
exactly what they were supposed to do. And if that was rough for us, we've been on the other side of that seat, too,
1:06:55
right? And then sometimes that sucks. Um, and I I sincerely hope that there
1:07:00
wasn't anything malicious or, you know, gross about that. Um, I would also maybe
1:07:07
hope that in the interim of the time that you spoke with Mr. Cook and when this by the time that you were at a city
1:07:14
council meeting, maybe that's when like during that time is when the salary element came up. Like maybe he didn't
1:07:20
know about it when he sat down with you. Like that that could be a possibility too. Um, so I think that in the event
1:07:27
that these were questions that he had, we also know holding public meetings, we
1:07:32
don't necessarily discuss every single question that comes from somebody speaking at a meeting. That's a very real thing. So a lot of
1:07:39
these conversations are, you know, if we don't address someone's question, they don't necessarily understand that. Then
1:07:44
we get the emails or we get the phone calls. So that is also something that I would maybe um
1:07:51
not necessarily say encourage you to do but but hope that that is something that you did try to do before um bringing
1:07:58
this here. No thanks m and I have reached out and
1:08:04
have set up meetings with all the city council folks just to understand a little bit more about
1:08:10
their timeline just FYI here's from us just to make sure lines of communication are always open. So, yep. Appreciate it.
1:08:22
Any other questions for Dr. Bloom? I would also like to say just on the note of the TIFF thing and knowing the
1:08:29
other like not wearing my schoolboard hat, wearing my my Meg in Dallas Center hat, um the things are really really
1:08:36
exciting happening in Dallas Center and it's absolutely a time for Dallas Center to be growing roots. Right. This is all
1:08:44
in the we are growing sustainably and responsibly kind of way. And the end
1:08:51
result result of all of this is to bring families to Dallas Center and to bring kids to our schools. Like this this
1:08:58
might be like a spend money to to earn money kind of thing in the future. It's very cool stuff. And that's why to be
1:09:05
honest I was so kind of bummed out was it has been such a great partnership and
1:09:11
a lot of people I'm not a lot several of the board of city council members are the same ones that I've met with
1:09:16
multiple times about things related to DCE in particular.
1:09:23
My argument was I don't know what a city administrator does but it sounds like
1:09:28
urban renewal projects are what you should do. So to have the school pay for
1:09:33
a portion of your salary just the the superintendents I had tried to talk to
1:09:39
because I was the dumb guy that had never seen that. They were just like that's that's not a normal thing and so
1:09:45
it's probably fair to ask questions. So I think my argument was more about no that's great get all the people
1:09:51
there. That's that helps everybody. I just don't know why your salary was part
1:09:57
of this tiff project when I'm guessing your job is to get people to come to Dallas
1:10:04
center and do all the stuff that's listed in here. I think that was more of my concern of the project itself. So
1:10:14
any other questions?
1:10:21
Okay, I direct your attention to the revenue and expenditure uh budget
1:10:26
comparison uh for the month of November 2025. You'll note that we're 45% through the
1:10:33
year and our expenditures are 28.31% of the appropriations for this year. The
1:10:39
total appropriation listed here is about 50.8 million. We're right in line with
1:10:46
where we have been the last four years. um just a percent or two under uh where
1:10:51
expenditures have been often that is impacted what by when open enrollment
1:10:57
bills or special education bills are paid. Um, looking at revenue in that same
1:11:04
report, you'll see that at 45% uh through the year, we're at 28% of
1:11:10
revenue as well with several pieces being at 100% including um some of our
1:11:18
grants. The uh early uh successful progression of early readers grant is
1:11:23
already at 100% and u most of the state aid is at 20%. This is something you'll
1:11:29
see monthly. we continue to monitor and keep an eye on uh just so that you have a pulse on where we are in the operating
1:11:36
budget. Moving forward to the public budget comparison report for the month of
1:11:41
November 2025. Once again, you see we're 45% through the school year with uh the
1:11:47
comparison of total expenditures for all funds versus the amount you published in
1:11:53
the newspaper during the certified budget is all under that uh piece from
1:11:59
ranging from anywhere from 9% uh from your uh operating transfers and bond
1:12:04
issue funds uh up to 32% in total support services. So, we will continue
1:12:11
to monitor that as we move through the year and determine if we need to amend
1:12:16
our budget. Okay. Um, next, uh, USDA farmtoschool
1:12:24
grant. This is exciting news. Uh, we applied for the USDA Patrick Lehy
1:12:31
farmtoschool state agency formula grant. Uh it is federal dollars that flow
1:12:36
through the federal or the Iowa Department of Education's Bureau of Food and Nutrition. Uh we requested 15,000
1:12:44
and were awarded 14,000 to use towards nutrition education and school garden
1:12:50
activities. And so we have some really neat things planned as part of this grant. Chartwells will partner with us
1:12:57
uh with food service director Matthew Pasma taking a big part of that as will
1:13:04
our district culinary educator uh Joseph Gro uh utilizing hydroponics in uh
1:13:12
different areas. About 150 different kids will get to experience uh the
1:13:17
actual seed planting and being part of that hydroponic garden. and most of the
1:13:22
district will get to taste what we grow uh through the food service program. So,
1:13:27
more on that as we move through this federal grant. Uh this is the first time in my recollection that we've received
1:13:34
federal grant dollars in the nutrition fund. So, exciting times in that area.
1:13:40
Finally, um, uh, after November 4th, when the bond issue passed, uh, we
1:13:46
started moving at lightning speed to, uh, get going for a December bond sale,
1:13:53
uh, of approximately $15 million. And part of that is having a credit rating
1:13:59
service uh, determine the uh, financial standing of the school district by
1:14:04
issuing a credit rating. And so on November 20th, uh, Moody's came back
1:14:10
after our interview and upheld the double A2 rating. Uh, they note that our
1:14:15
profile reflects a solid financial position and high resident income ratio.
1:14:21
Uh, you'll notice in the report that it says growing enrollment. They aren't looking at the short term. They're
1:14:26
looking at a 10-year window for that enrollment. Uh and at each time we move
1:14:32
forward to sell a bond of this 88 million, this will be part of the process. They will uh review the
1:14:38
district's financial uh standing each time and issue a credit rating in
1:14:44
advance of that bond. So it it says a lot about the board's uh
1:14:50
responsibility and actions that you take to pre-levy uh as often as possible to pay off bonds
1:14:58
early. It says a lot about the actions that you take as a board to uh levy
1:15:04
property tax for cash reserve at the time that you have the opportunity to do so. Moody's is very keen on did the
1:15:12
board take the actions they could regardless of tax rate at that point in time to maintain their fiduciary
1:15:18
responsibility. So bravo to all of you for achieving that financial standing.
1:15:25
Well, Michelle, I think the board gets uh credit for taking your guidance is what we get credit for. So, thank you
1:15:31
for u keeping an eye on that. U bringing really good intel back to the board in
1:15:38
terms of how we can make the right moves. And I don't know, this is maybe I don't know how many bond sales in a row
1:15:45
where you've got the double A2 rating. So, I know that's a badge of honor for you. Thanks for the work you did to maintain that.
1:15:50
I may have danced. Well, you tell the story well, so there's uh I'm sure that was worth a few
1:15:56
points. I can confirm when the rating came, Michelle's emoji game is strong.
1:16:02
She was she's a good emoji game when she's happy.
1:16:07
Any other questions for Michelle? Okay. Um item F, uh ISB conference was
1:16:16
uh this last week and I know uh Julian Shaylee, you had some some time there. Um, if you'd like, uh, this is a time
1:16:23
where you could share a little bit about the conference, what you learned, what you attended. The board would love to
1:16:30
hear about your day at the, uh, ISB conference. You want me to start? Um, so again, it was
1:16:37
they put on a really good like great presenters. I was really impressed with the two main presenters we had. Um, I
1:16:43
would say there was kind of some overall themes that I kind of got, but just um, kind of focusing on our why. we're, you
1:16:50
know, we we focus on our how and our what, but really focusing on why we're here and and why we do what we do. Um,
1:16:55
and then building those relationships and that in turn kind of um build our culture. Um, and then that um they had a
1:17:03
little video at the beginning, but all children can learn. And so really, you know, um and and also looking at the
1:17:10
future ready, like making sure that not only can they learn now, but what are we doing for our kids um for postsecondary?
1:17:16
Um I will kind of talk a little bit about the first presenter. I really enjoyed um him, but he kind of had five
1:17:22
reasons how to lead with purpose. Um stay hyperfocused on our purpose, which is kind of talking about our wise. Um
1:17:29
foster a culture where people are valued. U I feel like DCG does a really good job of that. Um something that I
1:17:36
know we're always um I know you do a good job of that. Um Dr. Bloom is just Yeah. making sure that our people are
1:17:42
valued. That is um I think important for us. A key to building culture is having
1:17:47
empathy for the hidden stories. Um it was very interesting he put on the
1:17:52
screen um if we had a new student coming in, she's a female uh she has missed
1:17:57
like 30 some days of school and been late 20. What would your impression or your thoughts be of that student? Um and
1:18:04
kind of we talked it as a table um and that you know other behavior issues. Do
1:18:09
they have family um maybe the family situation's not good? um disability
1:18:14
learning um all these things. Well, it was his daughter and she had a severe
1:18:20
allergy and in order to do therapy to kind of um deal with that allergy, it was two hours away one way and so she
1:18:28
was constantly going back and forth to do this allergy testing and therapy or whatever it was. So, just kind of
1:18:33
looking at how we perceive numbers don't necessarily tell the story. We're really
1:18:39
big in data and I love data, don't get me wrong. I think it is very important but also looking at kind of the hidden
1:18:44
stories behind that data. Um so that one is kind of the biggest one I think for me. Um one of the things he said is our
1:18:50
own lenses can get in the way. So when we look at it here it may be a different um something behind the scenes that
1:18:57
maybe that we need to not us necessarily but just um understanding work to
1:19:02
understand all perspectives of complex issues before making decisions. That's very important, I think, for us as a
1:19:07
board um to making sure that we're getting all sides before we make decisions. And then great school boards
1:19:13
are intentional in their communication. Um I think we do I think that has um
1:19:20
gotten better. Um our communication, not so as a school board, I think it is, but just also as a district, I think we've
1:19:26
done a really good job of continuing to improve our communication. So, but a lot
1:19:31
of AI stuff. There was a lot of um kind of uh breakout sessions on AI um school
1:19:38
board school board culture. Um so yeah, a lot of good stuff happening. I'll have
1:19:43
I'll kind of report with um Dr. Bloom on all kind of the nitty-gritty stuff that we learned. But yeah, it was it was a
1:19:49
good day. So it was a great first kind of jump into
1:19:56
the whole thing. You know, those conventions are made to kind of get you excited and it surely did. It was, you know, they start off with those
1:20:02
motivational speakers that really um, like Shay had said, just really get you back to the why of why we're here, the
1:20:09
powerful videos that they do, all of that type of thing. Um, I think one thing that hit home to me, um, they
1:20:15
mentioned like characteristics of a healthy community. We have to take care of our community and, you know, passion,
1:20:21
vision, content, a place together, and consistency. Just all things that we really need to look at and focus.
1:20:27
getting back to that why. Um I think one thing that's really important to me is the relational feature of it and both
1:20:34
speakers both talked about how their families and their kids were impacted by
1:20:39
schools, by the community, by the school, uh you know, just all of that. Um the one lady was a very successful um
1:20:47
she was in and out of like ESPN. She was in the locker rooms like interviewing and stuff, but at home like she had a
1:20:54
child that had just some issues that they were working through and how they worked through it. And you know, he
1:20:59
joined this water polo team and they just found community there and just got him from like not wanting to go to
1:21:06
school to like wanting to go every day and getting his grades up and it just it was just it just brought everything home
1:21:12
to like it really is important that we have this community that each kid really does matter. Um, I was able to see a
1:21:18
couple of breakout sessions. One talked a lot about bullying, harassment, and how it's kind of a a multiple instance
1:21:26
situation that we need to look at instead of tying it back to a specific, you know, trait or what what that type
1:21:33
of thing. So, that was kind of eye opening to me. And then the other one um that Bloom and I sat in on was
1:21:38
interesting was the 4day school week. Um, and Sadell actually is rocking it
1:21:44
with it. um pulling up the just all of the stats because again like we can talk
1:21:49
about how great it is, but when they actually showed like the just the a few things like recruitment and retention of
1:21:56
teachers, they went from having a handful of people um applying for jobs to like hundreds of of teachers
1:22:02
applying. And so in that they just added 30 30 minutes was it 30 minutes a day I
1:22:09
think to their schedule. And then Sadell has Fridays off if I remember. There
1:22:15
were a couple other schools that had Mondays off. So again, just it was nice to kind of look at that and what they
1:22:20
were doing well with it. Um all of those things. So I just appreciate the opportunity to be able to go. It was a
1:22:26
great day kind of a jump start to this to me starting. So
1:22:32
thank you both very much. Any any questions?
1:22:38
All right. Uh we don't have any old business. We took care of that in the prior meeting. Uh moving along to uh new
1:22:44
business. Item A. Uh set the monthly uh meeting days in time 5:30 and location.
1:22:53
Uh I don't think that there's any changes uh to the summary from uh the
1:22:58
prior year. Uh there are some u modest changes relative to December, March, May
1:23:05
and July to avoid some uh activities and holidays. Looking for a motion.
1:23:12
Move to approve. Dickson. Second. Viella. Any discussion?
1:23:17
On here it says Monday, December 15th, but I believe that's incorrect. It's
1:23:24
actually been changed to the 17th with the 5:00 pm start for the work session. Correct. Correct.
1:23:29
Okay. And let me double check, Nancy, why you said that because I don't want I'm just asking because I have to
1:23:36
rearrange my life and so I need to set like four. We have to approve that.
1:23:42
Got it. Slow down. I just want to make I'm sorry. There's just many shifting
1:23:49
pieces and reminder text messages that must be sent to myself.
1:23:56
Okay. Excuse me then. I digress. No, you were great. It was great.
1:24:03
26. Yeah, that would be for this meeting though because the the Monday
1:24:10
the Monday you guys are in Kansas City. You said the 15th 16th. It's an overnight which means that we're
1:24:15
switching it to the Wednesday and then the Monday we were supposed to be five today but we switched that to the 16th.
1:24:22
Yeah. and December 2026 would actually be part of next year's calendar and it
1:24:28
would be the 14th. So, you're you're right on that, but we'll take care of that in in um a later action. So, it's
1:24:35
good call. Okay. Any other discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I
1:24:43
post same sign. Motion carries. Item B, uh board committees. I'm going to uh
1:24:50
call an audible here and let's um maybe go through the committees as we can. Everybody's got a paper copy of them in
1:24:56
front of us. We'll uh assign the board member names to the 2526 column. Uh and
1:25:03
then we'll bring a motion to the table and then vote on that if uh if the board's okay with with that path. Um
1:25:11
building and grounds. Uh last year we had Mcnes Fial and Baker Curtis. Uh so
1:25:18
maybe the first question is uh Nick and Nancy, is that a committee that you'd like to remain on?
1:25:24
Yes. Okay. And then uh is there anyone that would like to volunteer? We can have up
1:25:29
to three board members on a committee. We don't have to have three, but we can't have four or more.
1:25:36
I'd like to jump on that. Okay, great. Nancy, you want to stay, right? Yes, please. Good. You got it.
1:25:45
Okay. Uh negotiations. Uh we've Carpenter Bombberg and uh Vanderveld and the three
1:25:53
of us have have done that for a couple of years now. Um that would be a
1:25:58
committee though that I think you have to have two board members that if continuity yeartoear just because
1:26:04
there's so much that carries over. Uh but is there another board member that would uh has real interest in being part
1:26:11
of the negotiations committee? And if not, we can keep it how it is as
1:26:17
well. I think a part of that discussion, Ryan, um would have to do with when that
1:26:24
committee meets and kind of the responsibility of that committee because I think, correct me if I'm wrong, you
1:26:30
guys have had some morning meetings and so that makes that committee something
1:26:36
that you would have to consider as a person. I can give some context on that. So that this committee doesn't meet a ton uh
1:26:43
really between uh call it uh 1 of May and
1:26:50
um and call it 1 of of maybe March or
1:26:55
maybe 1 of February. February. So but in that window between February and May, it's it's pretty busy and at
1:27:03
least once a week if not a couple of times a week. um you're a little bit at
1:27:08
the the mercy of the legislature because they've got to pass SSA even though the law says they have to pass it by
1:27:14
30 days they never do. Um so um apparently we need to follow the rules
1:27:21
but they I'll digress for a moment but um
1:27:26
yeah well nevertheless uh so anyway so during that period of time it it does get pretty busy. I think
1:27:33
there's a couple of other things we've tried to take on uh something new in
1:27:39
terms of a a big rock in that space every year. So last year I believe or maybe two years ago we spent pretty
1:27:46
significant time helping understand the benefits package and prior to that we
1:27:51
hadn't pushed out uh a statement of benefits. So Michelle's team was kind enough every year uh they it's kind of a
1:27:58
co total compensation statement. So sometimes you hear, well, I can go to another district and make X or Y. Well,
1:28:04
do you really understand what your full compensation package really is valued at here at Dallas Center Grimes? And if you
1:28:11
were to look at a different opportunity, at least you have all of your salary and benefits information in terms of total
1:28:17
cost. So, you know, those um kind of ancillary items that you take on take some more time. Uh so this year, uh for
1:28:24
example, we'll need to spend some time talking about uh salary schedule and structure. That's something that we
1:28:30
agreed as a group that we would take up this year. So anyway, so yes, it is a significant uh time commitment for about
1:28:37
three months or three and a half months there. Thank you for that.
1:28:42
Yeah, you bet. And with that, I'm not interested any
1:28:48
because I cannot be there in the early morning. I'll stay.
1:28:54
Okay. Would like to stay for? I would too. Okay. All right. Um, legislative
1:29:01
representatives, uh, Meg and, uh, Shay Lee was an alternate, uh, as the ISB
1:29:08
delegate, uh, any thoughts from the two of you about that. Uh,
1:29:14
I was not able to attend this year, but I would happily continue that role. Um,
1:29:19
if that's something that everyone's immunable to. Sure. I mean, if you need an alterate, that's
1:29:26
fine. I don't think I need to go unless Meg can't. Um, just let me know.
1:29:32
Great. All right. Uh, Meg, I I'm unfortunately
1:29:37
I'm not sure you have any choice. Yeah, I'm the only one. Which does bring up a
1:29:43
very interesting point just to like put this out there in the universe. In the event that since district 5 does incorp
1:29:52
or doesn't encompass part of crimes in the event that there is not a Dallas County resident on the board. What does
1:30:00
that do for you? What happens then? I don't know. Food for thought.
1:30:07
Guess I'm a permanent fixture. I don't believe the requirement is that you have to be a resident. It's just
1:30:13
been something that we've always designated as important. Okay,
1:30:18
fair point. Good. Nick, you uh did Pulk County last year.
1:30:24
Is that something you'd like to stay with? Yeah, I'll stay on. Okay.
1:30:32
All right. Sak uh Nancy and Shaye Tay on if
1:30:37
yes and and another board member could join if they would like.
1:30:45
Okay, we'll keep that the same. Uh facility planning uh Carpenter Mcnace
1:30:52
Mombberg. Um but it Shaylee, it seems like you
1:30:57
you're spending a fair bit of time with that. I am. Yeah. Okay. But I know that and I think Julie
1:31:04
might be interested too. So no I I mean it doesn't you know kind of constitution whatever.
1:31:09
It's totally I'm I I am very interested in it but I also know other people are as well. So I don't want to Yeah.
1:31:16
And did you want to stay on? Okay. I'm happy to step off of this one
1:31:22
if you'd like to join. Sure. Yep. Thank you. You bet.
1:31:41
Okay. Policy review. Um, Momberg and Dickinson.
1:31:48
I love that one. You love that one? I do. Yeah. That's kind of your jam. What can we do
1:31:53
for any other board members?
1:32:00
I will I will join this one.
1:32:10
Okay. Wellness. Uh Nancy and Shaylee.
1:32:15
Okay. Anyone else like to join?
1:32:20
Okay. All right. Um
1:32:26
we'll uh I think we can make a general uh motion uh that committees has noted.
1:32:33
Uh looking for a motion. Move to approve. Dickson second. Yellow.
1:32:39
Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I
1:32:45
I post same sign. Motion carries. Item C, substantial
1:32:50
completion of the DCE building envelope roof project. Looking for a motion.
1:32:55
Move to approve. Dickinson. Second. Picker Curtis. Any discussion?
1:33:02
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I oppose. Same sign. Motion carries. Uh
1:33:09
I'm going to ask for a little help from Michelle on D, E, and F. Uh these all
1:33:14
three deal with the upcoming bond sale. So on D, Michelle, any additional
1:33:20
information you could share with the board? So uh first of all on number D, the
1:33:26
addendum to the agreement to serve as the dissemination agent for secondary market disclosure. Primary market
1:33:32
disclosure is when you're selling a bond, all the information that comes out in advance of the bond. Secondary market
1:33:40
disclosure is all of the disclosures that we're required to do annually to a platform called EMA. And that's part of
1:33:48
the SEC rules with regard to public bonds. And so Piper Jaffrey serves in
1:33:54
the role to help compile the information, get it uploaded to Emma, help us understand items when we need to
1:34:02
disclose specific items out to any bond holders. Let's say if we missed a bond
1:34:10
payment, that would be something that we would be required to disclose. So those
1:34:15
are called material events. If our rating changes from a double A2 to a higher rating or a lower rating, higher
1:34:22
rating, um that would be a material disclosure. And so Piper Jaffrey serves
1:34:28
in that role on all of our other bonds for secondary disclosure. So it makes sense to be consistent and use the same
1:34:36
firm uh for secondary market disclosure. Thank you for that. Looking for a
1:34:43
motion. to approve Vanderbeld then second Dickinson. Any discussion?
1:34:50
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Post same sign. Motion carries. Item E
1:34:58
uh engage allers and Cooney uh as bond council and disclosure council for sale
1:35:04
the 15 million uh dollars of general obligation bonds. Any additional information on this one, Michelle?
1:35:11
Sure. Uh, all serves in these two roles, but different attorneys in different
1:35:16
areas. One serving as bond counsel for us, that's Elizabeth Grove, and one
1:35:22
serving as disclosure counsel for us, and that's Kristen Cooper. And so the
1:35:27
different duties, um, the bond council serves as preparation of all the
1:35:33
documents, review of all the documents, getting everything ready to go to public
1:35:38
sale uh, for that bond. Disclosure Council serves on the back end of that. They look at that operating operating
1:35:44
statement, offering statement. They ask those questions. They do a continuing
1:35:49
disclosure with the district and ask me lots of questions about what is your private use, what are you doing with the
1:35:56
facilities, what is the timeline plan, etc., etc. And so, uh, Allers and Cooney
1:36:03
does this typically for many, many school districts across Iowa. They are the only bond council and disclosure
1:36:09
council that we've used in 30 years. And so, uh, we began that process with them
1:36:15
early on. This is just formalizing that relationship. Looking for a motion.
1:36:21
Move to approve. Malberg second.
1:36:26
Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I.
1:36:32
I. Post same sign. Motion carries. Item F, resolution directing the advertisement
1:36:39
for sale, approving electronic bidding procedures, and approving official
1:36:44
statement. Any additional information? So, this is the actual offering
1:36:50
statement where you are uh offering out to uh any bidder the full faith and
1:36:56
credit of the school district and our ability to repay up to $15 million in
1:37:02
bonds. Remember, we have authorization for up to 88 million, but there are timelines with those. And so, we sell
1:37:09
them in small pieces across a number of years to spread that out so that we meet
1:37:14
the guidelines of two years or three years depending on the amount. These uh
1:37:19
15 million is the tax exempt bond limit for a fiscal year, which is why we
1:37:25
scrambled to get done in 2025. So, thank you. Looking for a motion. Move to
1:37:33
approve Baker Curtis. Second, Dickson. Any discussion?
1:37:38
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Post. Same sign. Motion carries. Uh item G. I'm going to
1:37:46
just uh accept into record the bids received for trash and recycling. Um
1:37:51
kind of a cool story here. So I just give the floor to Dr. Bloom for just I just want to excuse me. Want to give
1:37:57
Travis and Sean a shout out because they're in their roles. are asking a lot of questions to why do we do this and how do we do this and um they saw a cost
1:38:06
to waste management for all of our you know our trash upkeep coming and going for upwards of 90 plus thousand and they
1:38:14
said I think some other people could do that. So, they put an RFP together and got Waste Management, Waste Connections, and Ankeny Sanitation to all bid. Um,
1:38:22
we're going to recommend staying with Waste Management, but for approximately $40,000 less dollars to be honest, to
1:38:29
kind of do the same thing. And so, just neat that they're asking questions and
1:38:35
not necessarily business as usual. So to be honest, I don't know what changed in the m waste management world, but I
1:38:41
think when they probably knew they had some competition coming their way, they probably needed to be ready that DCG
1:38:48
could go elsewhere. So to their credit, they figured that part out, but in kind
1:38:53
of one day they save $40,000. So great. Looking for a motion.
1:39:00
Move to approve. Second quant. Any discussion?
1:39:07
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Post. Same sign. Motion carries. Uh
1:39:13
item H uh would be to award uh the trash and recycling bid to waste management.
1:39:20
Looking for a motion. Move to award Baker Curtis. Second. Viella.
1:39:26
Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I. I.
1:39:31
Post same sign. Motion carries. Item I, the SBRC
1:39:36
application request uh for open enrollment not on the previous year. Uh
1:39:42
Michelle, any additional information here? Yes. Um the school budget review committee uh grants modified
1:39:50
supplemental aid or MSA which is what you would know as unspent authority or
1:39:55
allowable growth uh for uh modified or for uh open enrollment students who came
1:40:03
from another district but missed count day. And so for those situations uh we are
1:40:09
allowed to get authority for those. for our uh situation this year, it's $53,579.75
1:40:18
in authority that you're asking from the school budget review committee. Now, you may remember in past years, we used to
1:40:24
do this all in one big motion, one big lump, and the school budget review committee has given some guidelines that
1:40:30
these must be separate motions. So, you're going to see them broken out. In some years, we have also had increased
1:40:38
enrollment as part of this. we would get additional authority for increased enrollment that wasn't on count. Uh
1:40:45
unfortunately, we're not in that situation this year. So, you don't see that as one of these three motions.
1:40:53
Thank you, Michelle. Uh looking for a motion.
1:40:58

30 just kind of curious what that looks like or or if we're Yep. kind of what Yeah.
1:45:03
Yeah. So for the last sever typically it's like a building level thing that
1:45:08
they'll do. So for the teachers in different buildings they'll find a fun way to celebrate them at the building. For some of the district level stuff we
1:45:15
may host something here for other buildings to come in. But right now, it's more building that fun.
1:45:22
Perfect. Thank you. I'd just like to point out while you're still on this topic that for these five
1:45:28
individuals, that's 98 combined years of service and I think that that speaks volumes about the culture at DCG
1:45:35
and that is that's amazing. It's it's truly truly heartwarming. So,

1:47:16
motion. Move to approve and second Dickinson. Any discussion?
1:47:21
Congratulations. All those in favor indicate by saying I.
1:47:27
I oppose. Same sign. Motion carries. Uh item T the to
1:47:33
consider the high school sculpture 2 course edition. Dr. Bloom, could you give us some additional information on
1:47:39
this? You bet. And I Greg may jump on with something uh specifics about this course or or anything in general, but I want
1:47:45
the board to know um if a if a building, you know, typically it's it's OP or the high school want to add a course, uh
1:47:52
there's a pretty good sized document that uh the teacher typically with the principal will fill out and it's just
1:47:58
ask a lot of questions. What's the goal of it? How many students you anticipate? Dollars and cents, staffing. So, they
1:48:04
work through that. They work with their building principal. Then it goes to their building leadership team. So that team has to be kind of a part of the
1:48:10
approval process so to speak. And then we ask them to bring in Shana and Greg. Certainly we don't want to be adding a
1:48:17
course or changing a course that may impact standards or things like that. So then Greg and his team get involved and
1:48:22
then ultimately to me. So um you know this is kind of that that process with
1:48:28
sculpture 2. This is about um a desire for students. We've had sculpture one
1:48:33
for a while. a need to maybe uh offer um that course. And again, what what in
1:48:39
particular for this course and many courses that we looked at, it's it's an offering mechanism that does not mean
1:48:44
necessarily will happen. We got to get the right numbers of kids. It's got to work in the master schedule and the teacher schedule, but in this case, the
1:48:51
the teacher is there. Um potentially the master schedule will work out so it won't be an ad to the district other
1:48:57
than supplies. But in Denell Duncan, who would teach this class, if sculpture 2
1:49:03
gets on the list, that means something's coming off the list. So there's probably not going to be huge dollars and cents
1:49:08
different in terms of supplies, but at least that's the process of how it gets to you. And Greg, anything to add?
1:49:14
Yeah, it just matches up with painting, drawing, ceramics one through
1:49:21
four. This is adding a second level to the sculpture to reflect all meetings. So maybe something down the road they
1:49:27
want to students higher up that fits in what we're doing. Yep. A note on this. So, because of the order
1:49:34
of the handbook or the course coming next, this isn't in the course guide that you're going to consider next
1:49:40
because it hasn't been approved by the board. So, approved at this juncture right here. It would be added. So,
1:49:47
that's a no. Thanks, Greg. Okay. Great.
1:49:53
All right. Uh looking for a motion. Move to approve Baker Curtis.
1:49:59

1:50:05
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Oppose. Same sign. Motion carries. Uh the 2526 high school
1:50:15
course description book. Uh maybe just a thought, could we amend the motion to
1:50:21
include uh now that the board has accepted item T? Uh so we could amend the motion to
1:50:29
include item T. That way you wouldn't have to bring this back to the board for another approval. So
1:50:34
great. Whoever is making the motion, if you could just include that. Looking for a motion. Move to approve with the inclusion of
1:50:41

1:52:24
Correct. Yes. No, don't Yeah. Don't worry about 4:30. 5:00 right now, Tim may ask for 15
1:52:29
additional minutes. So, I'll get potentially a 445 start if that's possible. But right now, yeah, 4:30 is
1:52:36
not going to be an option. So, okay. 4:45 or 5. I just have a gap in care for 30 minutes that I got to cover.
