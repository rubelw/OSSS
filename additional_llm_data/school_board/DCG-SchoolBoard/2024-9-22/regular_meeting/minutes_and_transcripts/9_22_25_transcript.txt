2:20
All right. Good evening everyone. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Happy homecoming week
2:25
everyone in the district. Here we go. We're green. Good. Happy homecoming week to everyone. I thought,
2:31
you know what? What? As a high school principal, I wanted to spend one more extra night in the district with all my
2:37
favorite people. So, it's great to be here. No, there's this is a real celebration. So, I do appreciate it. I have a short presentation to share with
2:43
you tonight on some of the work that the high schools recently been doing over the course of the last couple of weeks as the school year has been started. And
2:49
that is what we call Mustang University. And so every Wednesday when we have early outs and our and our staff comes
2:55
together, we call it Mustang University. And I'm going to get into the reason why we call that. And our theme this year
3:01
and every year is going to be all means all. And I'll tell you a little bit more about that as well.
3:06
So you can kind of see here as you look at Dallas Center Grimes Mustangs here, when we talk about all means all, you can see that all we believe that all
3:12
students must learn at high levels. And what do we mean by all students learning at high levels? That means that all students learn at grade level or above.
3:20
So, we believe that all students that take the Iowa assessments, those same assessment scores that you just looked at, that they learn at their grade level
3:26
with their peers and or above, and for that very small amount of students that take alternate assessments. And right
3:33
now at the high school, that's less than five students, we want those students to still learn at high levels, we use the
3:39
four critical questions of the professional learning communities process to make sure that they still have rigor in those courses, too,
3:44
because we still want all students to learn at high levels. they may not meet those grade level standards that their peers are because they're on alternate
3:50
assessment. But we want to use those four critical questions of the PLC. And so we do this through the strategic plan
3:55
and we are so proud to bring this into the work of the high school, especially those core values. We'll talk about that throughout the presentation as well. But
4:02
every single meeting that we start with, whether it's at a large group at Mustang University, which which is in in the
4:08
Mustang Center every Wednesday as a whole high school staff, or whether they're meeting in their collaborative
4:13
teams within their PLC, we start with that mission statement, empowering every student to create their future. And we
4:19
want to identify what are the core values that we're teaching students in the classroom, in the hallways,
4:25
during activities, in extracurriculars, wherever it may be. So, as always, we focus on three big
4:31
ideas when we're working with students. We focus on learning, building a collaborative culture, and then obviously having results. And as as a as
4:38
a district team here, we just had a great great opportunity to look at results together in a collaborative manner while looking at learning. So, we
4:45
did a great job as a team looking at those three big ideas. So, when I think about Mustang
4:50
University, it is really designed to set our culture. We want to build what we call our collective efficacy. That means the way that I talk, we want all staff
4:57
members to talk. We want all staff members to see all students as a student
5:02
first, no matter what their background is. So, for example, Monica and I were just having some conversation. We do
5:09
have um about 150 students that are served in special education, but we want all of our staff members to see our
5:14
students as general education students first. We want all staff members to see our students served in talent in a
5:20
gifted program as students first. We want all of our staff members to see students that are served in English language as students first. And so we we
5:29
hold that as a part of our collective efficacy. We do that through our collective responsibility. We know that it's uncomfortable work sometimes being
5:36
self-reflective. We want to make sure that we continue to learn. We know that this will make our teams more productive. And then over time, we think
5:42
that our teachers will become better and that our student achievement will continue to improve because of that collective efficacy that we're we're
5:48
bringing forth across all of our staff. So when we come together at Mustang University, the idea and the concept is
5:54
simply is this. We've got Iowa State people in the room. We've got the University of Iowa folks in the room. I
6:00
went to St. Ambrose in Davenport. There's people that have gone to school outside of the state. We've learned in a
6:05
lot of different places as educators. But when we come to Dallas Center Grimes, we learn at Mustang U because we
6:11
want to be able to have that same comprehensive background of what works best for students while holding those
6:17
high levels together. The dedicated time that the district has provided for us and we thank you so much. building level
6:23
professional development, our PLC team meetings, the K12 Encore PLC's, our
6:28
collaborative teams, and then all this is done through evaluation processes. We have dedicated practices like prep. I'll
6:34
talk about that here in just a moment, our purpose, what's our role, the effort that we give, our progress, norms in
6:40
every meeting. We just did that as a district-wide team. We want to make sure that we're holding each other accountable, having agendas that have
6:46
evidence, student evidence at that, and then making sure that we're providing purposeful feedback for our students as
6:52
well. And then we talk about cultural shifts, right? And sometimes shift happens,
6:57
which is a good thing. As we work in a school, we want to see great shift moving from one end to the other. We
7:02
talk about a focus of teaching, moving into a focus of learning. Emphasize what's being taught into a fixation on
7:09
what is being learned. Not necessarily the amount of content, but really talking about proficiency. What are
7:16
essential learning targets? There's so much content to be covered, but what is essential for students to learn so they can move from one grade level to the
7:22
next grade level and making sure that they're proficient. So, so important going from a private practice to a
7:28
sharing practice. We'll talk about learning walks here in just a moment as well. And then how do we build students collective responsibility so that they
7:34
can build confidence within themselves? And that leads to great collaborative teams determining the priority of
7:39
standards as they're moving from one class to the next. So for example, from algebra 1 to algebra 2, making sure that
7:44
they understand the concepts from algebra 1, algebra 2, and then those departments, making sure that if I'm an
7:50
algebra 1 teacher and I'm passing a student up through the department, that they've mastered those standards and they're ready for that next particular
7:55
course and they're going to do a great job. That's part of the shift that needs to happen. So, one of the con um concepts that I've
8:03
introduced this year is what we call prep. So, when we sit down as any type of team, we we go through a process
8:09
called prep, which is what is your purpose? Why are you an educator? What makes you come to school every single day? What's your why? Why did you get
8:16
into this work? Why do you choose to work at Dallas Center Grimes?
8:21
What is your role within the team? Are you the team leader? Are you a facilitator?
8:28
Do you record the notes? What kind of effort do you bring to work every day? How do we know that your effort's going
8:33
to matter for students? And then how can we count on you to make progress? And so once we identify this process, we
8:40
know collectively at the table how we can move forward with the work when it comes to our agendas. So we do the work
8:46
of prep, which helps build our collective teacher efficacy. And we know that that's a shared belief. When you
8:52
talk about John Hattie, the most colle the the most research-based information that's out there on student success is
8:58
when teachers have collective efficacy. When teachers know how to talk like one another and share in a common belief
9:04
system. And so one of the biggest things that we're doing this year at Dallas Center High School is we are aligning
9:09
our beliefs. We see all students as general education students first. And we know that once we
9:15
align our beliefs, then we know that we can collaborate for all by all and do what's best for all students.
9:22
Now, it's it's tricky because there's a lot of moving parts, especially when it comes to a high school, a high school of about 1100 students. You think of all
9:28
the different courses that are offered. You think about the amount of square footage that's going on at the high school. You think about all the
9:34
different roles at the high school. When you think about core teachers,
9:39
uh, associates at the high school, non-certified staff, it's hard to get your arrows in the right direction. But
9:46
we know that collaboration is king and we do our best to make sure that we have a collaborative culture of teamwork and
9:51
that we are constantly focused on our mission statement that's empowering our students to create their future. So
9:57
anytime we make a decision we want to make sure our arrows are going in that same direction. And one of the things that we will make sure is that we know
10:04
if we ignore things we endorse things. So if there are silos or pockets of things that don't match what we see on
10:10
the screen there of empowering every student to create their future we will not ignore those. we will make sure that we address those because like I said if
10:16
we ignore it we endorse it and so if we have individual silos or people are doing their own thing that don't line up with our values that aren't part of our
10:22
collective efficacy those are those are situations where we can grow from we can sit down and have conversation and see
10:28
what we needed to grow from that and so we can help build that shift that's necessary when possible
10:34
okay so our instructional leadership team very lucky I know that our district team members in the room know uh the
10:40
valuable members of our team Austin Roy Sheila Hudson and our assistant principles, Jolie Morgan and Lindseay
10:46
Casper, our instructional coaches, myself, we make up the instructional leadership team. We take a lot of pride in sitting down doing the research of
10:53
reading researchbased literature, using data to make informed decisions. And so
10:59
as we um come together every week before we get in front of our Mustang University staff, we want to make sure
11:04
that we model we make ourselves vulnerable for for our staff, that we are protecting collaboration time for teachers, making sure that they get that
11:11
time, that we defend the purpose of our professional learning communities, that we make sure that we're present, we're visible in the classrooms, we
11:17
build that support system in, we p provide clarity around the why and the collaboration, we build in that
11:24
feedback, and that we stay focused on student learning. And so recently this summer, I brought an idea and a concept
11:31
uh to the team about learning walks. And maybe this is something you've heard of in the past, maybe it hasn't, but it's
11:36
really kind of a cool concept. Last Thursday, uh it was a real celebration for our school. We had during second
11:42
block on September 18th between the between 9:45 and 11:10, we have about 18
11:48
teachers that took place in a learning walk. And I will tell you what a learning walk is. It's really simple. We had 18 staff members show up in the West
11:54
Cafe and we said, "Here's what's going to happen. We're going to partner you up just like we did previous to our board meeting tonight. And all you have to do
12:01
is this. In that partnership, you're going to get a clipboard. You're going to take those five core concepts, supportive inclusion,
12:08
um, innovation, inclusiveness, passion, and you're going to get specific
12:13
classrooms to walk in. You're going to spend about five to seven minutes in each classroom. And we just want you to look for those five core values, or one
12:20
or two of those core values, and if appropriate, move around the room, talk to students if you need to. look around,
12:27
see the walls, look down at the desks, and and make note of those areas when you get an opportunity to do that. And
12:33
so we covered 55 classrooms in about 25 to 30 minutes with those 18 people. And
12:40
just some of those quotes that kind of took off was through innovation in our alted program, which has been nothing
12:46
but a blessing to the high school, we've seen a wide range of students engaged in and being productive in our own
12:51
curriculum. We just had our first graduate just about two weeks ago which is really awesome. More to come too.
12:58
Students are sharing feedback that teachers are caring and they conduct check in check-ins often is passion. Uh
13:04
supportiveness. Teachers are sitting with students and listening to their needs and they're providing feedback with students on formative data
13:09
inclusion. Students have a seating choice. We're seeing audio enhancements. This is actually the first high school I've been in where where teachers are
13:15
using audio equipment so that all students can hear in the classroom. I thought that's just so great. Um, we
13:23
have a wide range of diverse role models that are being displayed in different classrooms. We've got a lot of diverse
13:28
students in in our high school, too, which is really, really neat to see. Opinions matter in our school. And then
13:34
finally, collaboration. A lot of our classrooms are built on small collaborative groups where where students are able to engage in those
13:41
small groups, have collective dialogue with one another, and that's being supported by our classroom teachers as
13:46
well. And so finally at the end of the learning walk session, those 18 teachers come back to the west uh commons area
13:52
and we were able to do a quick share out. AJ was uh great enough to put some of that on social media and most of the
13:58
feedback I got from our staff was this is the first time I got to see some of my colleagues in action which was really
14:04
great. A lot of our students said, "Boy, it was really neat to see other other teachers in our classes
14:11
um and kind of see some of the different learning opportunities that we're doing." you know, you had math teachers in art classes, art teachers in alt ed,
14:19
um, and so on and so forth. So, just imagine that kind of, you know, if you're in the medical field, if you're watching doctors kind of do medical
14:25
rounds, if you will. And so, this is a practice that we're starting to help build that collective efficacy to make
14:30
sure that we have all means all to make sure that we're empowering each student to create their future. And this is a
14:36
process that we'll continue to do through our Mustang University over the course of October, November, December, and the remaining parts of the school
14:42
year. just moving forward, we'll just shift from one block to the next to the next to the next. So everybody gets an opportunity to kind of share that
14:48
experience. And so as we get into the next part of the school year, our Mustang University
14:53
is up and running, which is great. And uh you know, we look forward to uh you
14:59
know, a great school year ahead. I mean, obviously it's September. I wish I had some other great stories to share with you, but right now we're off and running
15:06
and uh we're full steam ahead, if that makes sense. So, any questions that you might have about Mustang University?
15:17
I don't have a question about Mustang University, but uh I'm sure your first three months at DCG have been a bit of a
15:24
blur. Um, but you're you're interesting because on a lot of levels because you've worked in some other
15:31
Yep. Metro school districts and you probably have made some observations about Dallas
15:38
Center Grimes that are both opportunities as well as probably um you
15:43
know really perceive them as a a positive thing. If you could just maybe give us a couple of minutes. Yeah, Ryan that's I appreciate it.
15:49
That's a great question. First 90 days looks like and then and then finally maybe just as you you wrap up if you know is there anything
15:55
you need from the board is there anything we can be doing to support you? Um, just maybe just love to hear on
16:01
those couple points. Well, I think DCG is everything that I thought it would be and that's the reason why I'm here. Um, I came here
16:08
number one because I knew a lot of the leadership that was already here and I knew about the community. I think that's so important and it's everything that I
16:14
thought it would be. Um, I've been nothing but supported from day one and I appreciate that. I can't tell you that
16:20
enough. Uh, the student body is absolutely incredible. I mean, I know Scott and
16:26
Carrie will tell you that because they've they've been in that chair before, but when you walk the halls, I mean, I made friends the first day. I
16:31
mean, it wasn't going to be that hard to begin with with my personality, but I feel very comfortable uh going in and
16:37
out of classrooms, working with our staff. Um, I don't think I have had a chance to sit down and go to the
16:42
bathroom yet because I'm so busy, honestly. But, um, it's just been awesome. I mean, high energy,
16:49
um, working with students, working with families. I'm I'm I'm I'm with families quite a bit too, whether it's on the
16:55
phone or in meetings. Allison's been a great uh resource for me as well. We work with a lot of families handinand.
17:00
Um and it's a real united front and I like I think that's the best thing I could say is we lock arms and work with families together, which is something
17:06
that makes me feel very proud because I know um I take so much pride in in
17:12
making sure that all of our families get access to all of our, you know, all the different programs that DCG has to
17:18
offer. So, it has it's been it's just been awesome. And our football team's three in one. I think I have a lot to do
17:23
with that, too. No, I have nothing to do with that, but they're off to a great start. No, it's you know, and it's it's just been a it's been it's been great.
17:29
Uh I've sat down with different student groups. I've been really impressed with our students. Um I think this week's
17:34
going to obviously uh be amazing. And uh yeah, it's it's it's been a nice
17:40
honeymoon. I know that'll come to an end a little bit, but um everything that I came here for is happening, which I'm
17:46
really really excited about. So students and staff community has been been amazing. Yeah.
17:53
Yeah. And I think as far as support from the board goes, um if we could maybe not keep adding square
18:00
footage east and west and maybe go up. I've lost 14 pounds since the first day
18:06
of school. And I'm not People are like, "You look thinner." I said, "Yeah, you should see me. I am moving every day. It's great. I
18:12
love it." Um it's a lot of square footage. So, I think what we're trying to figure out Yeah. I mean, it's just
18:18
it's a big building, which is really cool, but um Yeah. I mean, at some point, we'll need more people and all and we're out of space.
18:24
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Good problems to have. So, no, it's all it's all good. And I would
18:30
anytime anytime you're more than welcome to if you if I can uh be a host, I think you guys know this. I'd love to take you
18:35
around the building, walk you into classes anytime. All you have to do is uh let Shauna know that you're here and
18:41
uh I'll take you on a tour or let the team know over here. We've lot of great things to see in those hallways. If you get a chance and want to come through,
18:47
I'd love to show you that. Great. Thank you. Any sound good?
18:52
Thanks everybody. I appreciate your time. Thanks for spending some time with us on a busy week. Appreciate it.
18:58
All right. Uh Dr. Krenza. All right. Good evening. I have just uh
19:03
three pretty short um things for tonight. So, first would be um uh state
19:09
reporting. So, it's been pretty quiet, so that's good. I think I shared that at the last meeting. and I gave you an update on most everything that we've
19:15
done. However, this week was the week that they came out with all the new reports. So, really quickly, we have a
19:21
K12 or preK12 desk audit that just um came out. So, that is where in the, you
19:28
know, a long time ago, they used to come out to schools and check through files and things like that. We submit and
19:33
upload. This would be things like our reading retention letter, our math counts, uh implementation plans. We
19:39
upload sample board policies of things that they're looking for. It's pretty straightforward, very easy for us to put
19:45
together, but that has begun and we will be working on that. Student reporting in Iowa. This is the document that just
19:51
takes initial fall data and non uh well, we finished the non-fall data. This will look at who's uh enrolled in which
19:58
programs in our district. We've gone and cleared out all the errors. And so now we will work with principles to make
20:04
sure that they're checking by each area and each program that we have the correct students listed. So that's coming up. Um that'll lead us then into
20:11
the uh student count the official count day coming up here in October. Title programs um we'll see title one and
20:19
title four and title oh I can't remember three maybe uh we'll begin to put in budget amounts and what we're projecting
20:24
to spend the monies on that will come out here and then last one is fall bed staff. Carrie and Jamie are working hard
20:31
on imple or updating fall bed staff. That's just where we account for their salaries, benefits, and their lure um of
20:39
who's in the district right now. So, pretty straightforward with state reporting.
20:44
Professional development. I'm not going to review all of those. I do want to say and reiterate um already our principles
20:50
used building time right at the start of the year to kind of check in on how things were going. We've already had PLC
20:56
times. We've had a district professional development aimed at drawing those ties together between our strong
21:01
instructional framework and our PLC's. Uh I do want to give a shout out again to our principles and our instructional
21:07
coaches. They're the ones that lead district PD down in their buildings. So I'm thankful for them because we're able
21:12
to do that together. Um and then lastly, I just personally love the flex days um
21:18
because it's groups that we don't always get to see that traditionally might not always get support. So you can see there
21:24
um we've been done some curriculum review. Shannana and her team has been doing curriculum reviews for science and
21:29
computer science. Ally and her amazing uh team have been working on um the differentiated accountability and
21:36
intensification of literacy resources and e and then our tag teachers are
21:42
preparing. Our tag teachers will be presenting at the Iowa talented and gifted conference coming up in the middle of October. They're going to talk
21:48
about their gifted self audit and plan that they've done. And we also had K12
21:53
nurses um have an opportunity to work with a consultant um who's helping them guide through best practice and best
22:00
best practices in the counseling program. And lastly, school nurses um spent some time making sure we have our
22:06
AEDs um up to date, that we have a tracking system, make sure we've purchased and resupplied materials that
22:13
they need to keep those up and running and they have PLC time. So really busy on the PE. I mean every Wednesday. We're
22:19
so thankful for that time. I personally am. So I feel like we can touch a lot of groups. So thank you for that. Lastly is
22:26
our bullying and harassment. Um just just some updates. What I want to provide for you are trainings that have
22:32
been happened to date. Um but I would also add we're planning on going to Dallas Center Grimes High School to
22:38
speak with staff on October 1st. That'll be our first presentation there. So I'm excited to meet with them. And then
22:44
we're also in the works of getting Heritage Elementary staff scheduled. We are going to be at Oak View at the end
22:50
of this week um with all seventh graders and then a couple weeks later we're going to be presenting to all eighth
22:55
graders, Gail and I. So um have a great opportunity to interact with the students again. So really positive
23:01
experiences. We have had several cases come in already that we're investigating and working through, but um that seems
23:07
to be on pace with um what happens when students come back. So helping them and and appreciative of Gail's efforts as
23:13
well. That's all I've got for you. Any questions at all?
23:19
Okay, Dr. Bloom. Thank you. All right, team. Good evening. Couple items for me. We had one single family
23:25
building permit in Grimes, uh, zero in Dallas Center for one total, so we're at
23:30
eight for our fiscal year starting in July. Enrollment.
23:35
I believe I shared in August that you know a little bit of a pause on what was
23:41
come with enrollment when we were starting to okay officially get records from all the schools that kind of takes
23:47
a couple weeks. It's kind of amazing to me that we are still getting these requests and documents today from
23:54
various schools across the state and country. So still a lot of moving and shaking but from last month you can see
24:01
we were down 31 students from the previous month. So again, most of that is now we know where some of these
24:08
students have gone that were enrolled. They've actually, you know, left over the summer and now have their their
24:13
records requested. But as we approach October 1st, which is count day, um, you
24:19
know, if count day was today, we would be down about 47 or so students right in
24:26
there. So that's kind of that towards the bottom of your page. 2024 certified enrollment was 3446.25.
24:33
25 the number to the left that really takes a look at resident students that live in DCG 3399
24:40
so you're roughly 47 or so students so I know the team in this building
24:45
principles are working hard trying to count for every kid um so they will keep plugging away but October 1st um next
24:53
week is the official count date so we'll certainly get out the official numbers
24:58
and what that means for DCG in the next few weeks jump in again with any questions team.
25:06
Um, next for me, the facilities master plan. So, as we prepare for the bond vote in November, again, been thrilled
25:14
to be able to speak to organizations. I get to hang out. Uh, last week, I think it was, I hung out with the Grimes
25:20
Chamber. Uh, they were a lot of fun. We're heading to the Rotary in a couple weeks. Grimes Dallas Center Rotary,
25:27
Grimes Area Democrats in in a week or two. So, as you keep, you know, hearing
25:32
of groups and organizations, please holler if they go out to coffee, we'll chat, we'll whatever we can do to kind
25:38
of brag up DCG. So, that's been fun. But in the meantime, between now and, you
25:43
know, the the bond and and beyond, we have OPN is starting kind of their
25:50
planning, listening session, steering committees with the different groups
25:55
that are going to be impacted. And it's going to start with the high school. So we will meet as kind of a district team
26:02
with them next week. So that's OPN, DCI, and then it'll be myself, Greg,
26:08
Michelle, AJ, Sean, Travis, Madison, and Matt will all sit down and kind of start
26:15
to get into high school heavy focus to start getting into the details. And then
26:20
the week of October 7thish, 9thish, somewhere in there, OPN will spend two
26:27
full days in the high school and they will take about an hour or so a piece and they will meet with the different
26:32
groups. So we're going to spend an hour with Altad learning about that. We're spend an hour with our uh admin learning
26:38
about this part of the building, the science team, right? all of the different groups that will be impacted
26:46
will get their time with OPN to kind of what's going well, what are we looking for, so OPN can start to really get into
26:52
the nitty-gritty of their work. So, what we're doing is trying to get ahead of some stuff because knock on wood, bond
26:58
passes, right? We are arguably 10 weeks ahead. Um, and we know this will be a
27:04
competitive bidding process. Other folks around us are getting started. um you
27:09
know with with their bonds we actually think we're we're getting ahead of some things. So this will be good to be ahead
27:15
but also most importantly get voices in the table. So it will start at the high school but then it will move to other
27:21
groups. So when it comes to inclusive playgrounds for example like there will be teachers and families that want to be
27:28
a share their their input with OPN like that will come as the projects start to
27:34
kind of get their attention. We just know the high school is the the big one that's going to take the most planning
27:40
in design time. So, they wanted to uh get after that one first. So, um we're
27:46
starting to get a rough schedule in place. Um you know, Michelle and I have certainly had our our talks with, you
27:51
know, the bonding companies just to again try to be ahead of everything and then fingers crossed we get that 60%
27:59
number that goes out in uh in votes um
28:04
on election day. So, any questions on facilities, specifically the bond stuff?
28:11
Just wearing my devil's advocate hat in the event. Yep. The very unlikely event, right? Yep.
28:17
Knocking wood that the bond does not pass. Um, and all of these meetings and the work
28:23
that OPN is doing like frontloading it, are we're on the hook for paying for
28:29
that. Is there like a a contingency fund? It's a great question. So, so we're
28:34
we're on the hook. Yes and no. There we're not on the hook, Meg, for like, hey, you just gave us 10 weeks of work
28:41
and shoot, it didn't pass, we still owe you 10 weeks. Like, it's going to be
28:47
built in to the bonding and planning structure. So, worst case scenario, we
28:53
don't get it right. All of that work that we hope we would ask for the following November is already done.
29:00
Got it. We essentially have worked out the fact that we would kind of sit tight together, do this again. Oh, wait. We've
29:06
already done this and now here's okay, payment. And so like we're
29:12
Yes, we are very optimistic of where we're going, but we are working with them on there. This is not like its own
29:18
individual project. This is still part of their design with the bonding stuff.
29:24
So, it will all come as part of the bonding package. there's not this additional item that we'll be paying for
29:31
if that makes sense. Yeah, great question. Yep. Thank you. Okay. ISB convention delegate assembly
29:38
is just a reminder that it's 19th through 21st. So we'll we'll remind you again in October. If you're interested
29:44
in going, please reach out to me and or Deanna. She'll get everybody registered and signed up accordingly. So love to
29:51
have you. You can make it. Um let me know if you've got any questions there.
29:56
And then last thing for me before questions was had an awesome awesome day
30:03
today. We did kind of our first formalized go around the district. So um
30:10
remember from our strategic planning and you know one of the things we wanted to improve on there and from the um you
30:18
know the feedback we got after end of last year from our staff is like we want to continue to find ways to to show how
30:24
grateful we are to recognize the awesome stuff we're doing. So uh Carrie and AJ
30:29
came together had a great plan to do this creator award around our five core values. So, our staff, this was
30:36
introduced in August at our back to school event and we sent them the link. It explained it and said, "Hey, if you
30:42
ever want to nominate a staff member for one of the five core values at DCG, hey,
30:48
say a little blurb about them, and we'll come celebrate them." Well, that turned out to be 23 or 24 people the first time
30:56
around. And if you put your name in like you celebrated somebody, we went and
31:02
thanked you today. There was not a magic number. We're trying to get every position. So when I share very quickly
31:09
the names of the people that got this creator award today from their colleague,
31:14
everyone that put it in got it and it's just an amazing list. So today we ran around and we celebrated staff members
31:21
with their principal with their director if we can. We read to them the creator award that was written on the staff
31:28
members behalf. They get a fun little magnet that you can kind of see in the picture and uh you know what the bigger
31:36
document is is the actual words that their colleague wrote about them and why they nominated. So it was really neat to
31:42
be a part of today. So Carrie, AJ and I we got to interrupt people in their classes. We got to freak them out. Not
31:49
everyone jumps up and down when HR communication superintendent come. Some of them have a quick question but no it
31:57
was a lot of fun to celebrate. So, very quickly, here's the list. One of these will be a surprise because they were gone today.
32:03
One of these is going to be a surprise. We had one teacher that was home with a sick kid, so we couldn't get to her. Um,
32:08
so if she's watching, she's going to find out we're coming. We like legit debated, do we drive to the house?
32:13
We said, "Do we just drive?" She's fine. It's just the little one. So, we almost drove to the house. So, Deb Ko,
32:20
principal, Dallas Elementary, and Mallerie Delacy, the counselor, were celebrated this morning. At the middle school, Sarah Cochram, who's a sixth
32:27
grade teacher, was celebrated. Uh Steve Dean, bus driver for us, was celebrated
32:32
by a colleague at Oak View. Becky Keeling, who is the head custodian, and Britney Walker, who was the one we
32:38
didn't get to see today, I'm not allowed to Britney, you're going
32:44
to be celebrated by four different people celebrated Britney. So, that was neat. At South Prairie, the kindergarten
32:50
teachers uh were celebrated by a colleague for their work with that kindergarten program. Three
32:56
interventionists were celebrated at South Prairie as well. And then Elise Webb, the instructional coach at
33:02
Heritage, a special education teacher, Bailey Canaly, and Diane Williamson, the principal, were celebrated. Again, to
33:08
just say it again, all by their colleagues. Someone else wanted them to be celebrated. At Northridge, we've got
33:16
uh Renee Conway, who Rene's in the bottom right, does incredible stuff for. She was celebrated. Heidi, instructional
33:23
coach. Uh Darla Vancutin is the head custodian, was celebrated, and and then
33:29
Cam Bane, one of our amazing associates. At the high school, we had Desiree
33:34
Lozada, language arts teacher. Beth Gross teaches health. Chris Adams is a special education teacher and then
33:41
Madison Meltch, our new AD, and Caitlyn, our activities admin assistant, were
33:46
celebrated. So again, I think I'm close to 23, but again, it's
33:52
Oh, thank you. You even have them. Kristen Clayton, who is our admin assistant at the front that you see once
33:57
in a while. She was celebrated by somebody. And then Shana Olsen, director of teaching and learning. So super cool.
34:04
It's, you know, it's it's didn't take a whole lot to come up with, but man, it feels like it's powerful. They were so
34:10
excited to be there. Kids got into it. We got a couple of tears. Um, we we
34:16
won't share all of it, but we had a staff member cry. And then someone goes, "Wow, you you do have feelings. This is
34:23
cool." Like, okay, I don't know that, but she was balling her eyes out without
34:29
it. And again, I think the most meaningful part of it is they know I'm right there. And sometimes the person
34:35
got to be there with us that nominated. So like there's there's Betsy Bajjo and
34:41
April Heightland in the top left. So Darla with the hat on, the head custodian. She was nominated by Betsy
34:47
Bjano. So we grabbed Betsy and said, "Hey, come celebrate with us." And again, when they hear the words that
34:53
someone else said about them. So, what I'll get to add to our board agendas is
34:59
um I'll be sharing at least maybe a little quicker than this, but our creator award winners for each month and
35:05
we had 23 or five this time and I'm thinking we're going to be there or more
35:10
in the future. So, it was a lot of fun to be a part of today. So, I think that is my list of topics.
35:17
What uh what questions can I answer? Anything else going on in the district?
35:25
This might be a little and this is it's going on in the district. So, um can you give us a quick update on the
35:32
kindergarten at South Perry that pilot how that's going? I don't think we've heard. Yeah. So, without I hope this answers
35:38
Okay. They're coming next month. Okay. They would like to share here's what we learned, here was the good stuff, here's
35:44
the feedback that we can get better at. So, we're actually on purpose going to bring that kindergarten team next month
35:49
and then um transitional kindergarten is going to come talk about life in transitional kindergarten so we can kind of have a talk about kindergarten in
35:57
general. So, they're both groups are going to come next month and just kind of share what they learn if that's
36:03
all good. Okay. Yeah. Thanks for asking. Okay. Thank you much,
36:10
Miss Wman. Uh, I would like to begin by telling you how incredibly hard it is to follow all
36:16
the excitement of the creator award with the certified annual fiscal report.
36:24
That being said, it should only take an hour, guys. No. Um, I'm just going to
36:29
hit some highlights. This is the certified annual report. It's an upload to the Iowa Department of Education and
36:35
then further to the federal department of education that analyzes what happened
36:41
in the district fiscally in the last year. This uh coincides with our fiscal
36:47
audit. These are audited fiscal or financial statements. And uh I'm just
36:53
going to highlight uh revenues, expenditures, and what fund balances were on specific funds uh for this year.
37:02
Beginning with the first page, those are revenues uh for each of the funds that
37:08
the district holds. I note to you that the general fund revenue was just over $49 million in fiscal 25 and uh that
37:19
revenues for the save fund were just over uh 5.8 million for that fund year.
37:26
Moving forward to the balance sheet, this kind of tells you where we end the fiscal year. And I'm going to look
37:32
specifically at unassigned fund balances, committed fund balances, and restricted fund balances in the general
37:39
fund. If you note that our unassigned fund balance at the close of the fiscal year is $9.9 million.
37:47
And we do have some restricted fund balances. Those are categoricals that are not yet completely expended. An
37:55
example of that would be um tag funds that aren't completely expended at the
38:00
close of the fiscal year. They are held for a specific purpose and thus they are restricted. Another example of uh uh
38:08
fund balance would be a committed fund balance. If you recall, the board took an action to commit $545,000
38:16
for uh few new staff but also for curriculum cycle. So uh that is what
38:22
that figure is in the balance sheet. Once you have the fund balance and the revenue for the general fund, you are
38:29
able to calculate the solveny ratio for the close of the year. Remember we talk
38:35
a lot about our ability to levy cash reserve and how it's restricted over the
38:40
course of years in kind of a flowing cycle. And I get to points where I can't
38:46
levy cash reserve because I hold too much cash at the end of a fiscal year. And then we draw down on it in the
38:52
subsequent fiscal years. We are at that peak and beginning that fall at this with our solveny ratio at 20.75.
39:01
And so this will be the peak for probably the next three years. Okay. Other fund balances to note to you. You
39:08
will note that we have a healthy fund balance in the save. That's the local option sales tax which we have been
39:15
reserving for future projects to go along with part of uh the proposed bond
39:20
issue that will hit ballots on November 4th. And so this will be some of the supplemental and phase 2 projects that
39:27
we've talked about. Um moving on from that uh we begin to go
39:35
through expenditures for each fund. I'm not going to go through each of those with you. I have printed you a copy so
39:41
it's a little more readable. This is a very tiny font. I'm sorry. Um but it it
39:47
does fit every fund on one page. Hooray. But general fund spending for the last
39:52
year is just over 48,480,000.
39:58
So our ex uh expectations in the new year are just over uh $50.5 million in
40:06
the general fund for the new year. That's a quick look at the certified financial report. I will ask you to
40:12
accept this report into records in new business. Moving on from that, another
40:18
part of the final fiscal reports uh for FY25 is the special education supplement
40:25
report. This report as you walk through illustrates how many resident students and how many non-resident students we
40:32
serve in special education. Noting that uh district residents served were 392
40:39
special education students and non-residents served um
40:46
totals just over 90 students.
40:52
Looking at what uh is the most important figure to take out of this is on the final page of the report. That's the
40:59
balance. It does review the revenues at the top, the expenditures in the middle,
41:04
and the fund balance at the very close. You'll notice that our revenues in
41:09
special education are 7.6 nearly $7.7 million. Expenditures uh for special
41:16
education at $10.1 million, leaving us with a deficit in special education of
41:23
just about $2.5 million. actually $2,467,926.
41:30
This is uh pretty level with what the uh balance was last year. We will ask the
41:37
board to uh accept any allowable growth granted to us by the school budget
41:43
review committee through our motion tonight. And then we would ask the board to levy back cash had we had the ability
41:50
to do that in the next fiscal budget but probably will not have the capacity to levy that cash back. So that'll be a
41:56
draw down on cash. Finally, last report to review would be
42:02
the annual transportation report. The bulk of this work is prepared by director of transportation Jeff Wolf. I
42:09
upload some of the financials into it. Just reviewing uh this report, if you uh
42:16
look at the last page, you'll see our route miles and uh miscellaneous miles
42:21
for the district are 255,000 miles with an average cost per mile
42:27
traveled of $521 a mile and an average cost per pupil
42:32
transported of $71420.
42:39
What questions do you have of those financial reports?
42:44
Maybe just a question on solveny ratio. You said that's kind of going to be the peak for the next three years. How do we
42:49
think about that as we get ready for a bond and bond rating? Any thoughts? So,
42:57
uh, as we prepare for, uh, specifically a Moody's rating, uh, one of the things
43:03
that Piper and I will do together is prepare for that interview and explain how the board manages that eb and flow
43:11
of cash and the fiscal actions that this board has consistently taken, which is important to Moody's to be able to show
43:18
that consistency, to show that fiduciary responsibility and levy levying back the
43:23
full amount of cash when you have the opportunity to do So, so that that takes
43:29
advantage of refilling the coffers when the time is necessary um regardless of how that hits on the
43:37
tax levy. And so that's important to Moody's that they know that they can count on that um consistency with the
43:43
school board as they u manage finances for the district.
43:51
Any other questions for Michelle? Thank you. Thank you.
44:00
All right. Uh, no old business tonight, so we'll move along to new business. Uh,
44:05

45:35

45:40
Move to accept. Dickinson. Second. Fella. Any discussion?
45:47
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Post. Same sign. Motion carries. Uh we've got some parent
45:55

46:00
Vanderfeld. Second. Dickinson. Any discussion? This sounds really cool. I think this
46:06
will be a really great feature to help uh communicate effectively.
46:11
Thanks for your work there, AJ. All those in favor indicate by saying I
46:17
oppose. Same sign. Motion carries. Um Dr. Bloom, can you give us a little bit
46:24
on item F, the D Carlo demolition scope of work? Sure. So, if you're at the uh you know
46:30
our our ball fields over in Dallas Center, we've got the old the older kind
46:35
of four plus years we haven't used the varsity softball kind of you know field and and they've
46:42
got a little concession stand and restroom etc with it. Well, we use it
46:47
four to five times a year, maybe. And the upkeep of that is significantly more
46:54
than what this would be to just kind of tear down what's there. It's a lot of
46:59
winterizing costs to start it up again. Every time there's a Sean was sharing with me last, every time there's a water
47:05
issue, it's about a $5,000 fix for some. So, we're just probably putting too much
47:11
money into something we're not using. Um, a neat update on here from a dollars
47:17
and cents perspective is as you see on here it says the um removal of bleachers as well. In fact, we actually sold those
47:23
bleachers for $32,000 on gov deals. So, we're actually going to just turn around and take care of
47:29
this, right? So, we're actually ahead. So, it's more of a we just don't use it um enough. Let's let's not be spending
47:36
money on something we don't use. And down the road, if that's something we get back into, um it would be prudent of
47:43
us to build a nicer set of restrooms for our famil family's concession, etc.
47:49
Right now, it's just old and not functioning very well. So, time to come down. So, this is the only restroom concession
47:56
that's out there. There's not a second one that I'm aware of. Right. It's the main one. Or is there another one? Yeah, this this is the one the old
48:03
by the parking lot. by like the south well no be the north
48:09
east side shay this has nothing to do with our current current baseball
48:15
just making sure that yes yeah nope it is kind of when you come in from the north there's that little youth
48:21
so there's still another bathroom yep good question
48:28
looking for a motion move to approve mberg second della Any discussion?
48:37
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Oppose. Same sign. Motion carries. Uh
48:43
first reading of uh listed policies. There's quite a number of them. I think there's 20 odd of them. Most of them are
48:49
administrative updates, but there's a few new ones. Looking for a motion.
48:54
Move to approve. Dickinson. Second. Wberg. Any discussion?
49:01
Oh, I have one. Oh, two things. But the class size, class groupings, that's 607.04.
49:08
It does say optional kindergarten. We might want to update that to transitional kindergarten. Okay. And then the equal educational
49:14
opportunity, the complaint form, removing those. Can we just get a little bit more background on why we're
49:19
removing those from the complaint form 102.E?
49:27
Let me pop that. Sorry. No, good questions. Appreciate it.
49:36
No, you're okay. Just removing things like the
49:42
gender, identity, physical attribute, political belief, other like you can't
49:47
do an other now for the complaint form. This was an all recommendation that
49:53
removed I mean like a lot of things. Yeah. Um
50:00
I don't have that exact information. I apologize. Um that would be just one
50:06
where we went back through or I'm sorry.
50:12
Okay. And um that would have been the ones that they did not have in their policy.
50:17
So if someone does so if there is any bullying or harassment issues that deal
50:23
with these items that we're crossing off, does that mean what does that mean?
50:28
Well, kind of like back to what we talked about earlier, we would still address those within um the district. I
50:34
mean, any complaint that comes in regardless because now we do not report that to the state. That's not where
50:40
there is not disagregated by the what we believe the reason for the bullying is. So, that would not change any of that.
50:47
No. So, how do people know though that they can still submit a complaint form when it doesn't
50:54
maybe follow one of the ones that we only have listed now? that I mean that's a great question. I think to me that
50:59
could come back to us doing some more. I mean we've gone around to building leaders. We've gone around to the te the
51:05
staff we will present to students in those presentations. I mean we're we're crystal clear about hey this anything
51:13
that comes to us we have to deal because basically the definition is repeated or targeted behavior that ps students
51:20
either a fear of harms to themselves you know withdrawing of participation of activities performance on grades so I
51:28
mean that could be something where we publicly communicate maybe I think I could see parents maybe
51:34
you know if we're crossing all these things out does that mean you know I just want to make sure we're communicating that that this does not
51:39
mean that we're not going to Yeah, I could work with I mean and I think it's time a couple years ago we
51:44
did a um podcast okay you know around bullying remember that okay um I I think that communication
51:51
could absolutely happen and it's important too yeah I just want you know people do look at that and may have concerns I just
51:57
want to bring that up that we're communicating out why we're doing that and that it doesn't affect y what we're doing good point
52:06
any other discussion I just wanted to say that I appreciate on the class size policy the um addendum
52:14
to determine by accounting general education students um but also that there are suggested maximums with
52:21
special accommodations given that Dallas Center Elementary specifically has had
52:26
um some class size discussions and so yeah having that in policy is just
52:31
nice. Thank you. Thanks. Any other discussion? All
52:38
right, I'll move slow vote. All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Oppos. Same sign. Motion carries.
52:46
Uh move along to um item H, the
52:52
resolution to set a public hearing to consider exchange of real estate with the city of Dallas Center. So you want
52:57
to maybe give us a little Y. I don't know if it's possible to throw that
53:03
second uh the land exchange DCG athletic fields up there, but if not
53:09
team, feel free to look at it on your computer. So, um, having great conversations with the city of Dallas
53:14
center on our 2080 agreement. So, if you're able to kind of look at that second document, sorry, it's a little
53:22
little funky when you look at it. Um, but right now when we look at the
53:28
Bernett complex, yeah, AJ, thanks. It's it's at the bottom. Again, sorry it's
53:33
it's going to look sideways, but really the main thing we're talking about for the land exchange and what we have to do
53:40
first before we finalize the 2080 agreement, if there's going to be a land swap, and in this case, we're proposing
53:46
a land swap with the city of Dallas Center. There needs to be a hearing with the public so they can, you know, certainly share their input when you're
53:51
talking about public land being swapped. But if you can see with me, please,
53:57
let's focus on letters A and H. So
54:03
letter H is really our mainly our freshman baseball field. So we play a
54:09
lot of our uh freshman, you know, sometimes sophomore, whatever games there. Well, and there's a little kind
54:15
of parking lot kind of where D would be that is owned by the school district.
54:22
Letter A is the varsity baseball field. And then if you go to the to the north,
54:29
that letter D in um kind of that parking area to the north, A and D are owned by
54:37
the city of Dallas Center. They have been incredible partners, but it's just a little odd when we want to
54:43
do something on the varsity baseball field, we've got to go get their permission. They've got to go to their
54:49
city council. They've got like it's just time consuming and everyone's great. But
54:55
when we've been working with the city of Dallas Center on the 280 agreement, our first thing both sides said is, "Well,
55:01
Dallas Center says we'd like to use more of the youth fields kind of in the middle, including letter H maybe for our
55:07
own tournaments on the weekends, etc. What if we got H and some of the parking
55:12
on D and then you guys got A, your varsity complex and some of the parking there to the north?" Yes, we can still
55:20
use letter H for freshman baseball games. that will all be written in the 280 agreement of how we still continue
55:25
to work together and share. But we just thought that was a a brilliant arrangement of we have ownership of our
55:33
varsity complexes and then they get ownership of kind of the letter H.
55:39
They're just some funky lines and some different things that we are going to clean up and the 280 is in a great spot.
55:46
So, but this is the first step and then eventually we'll be having the same conversation with the city city of
55:52
Grimes with the south and north complex because again the lines are funky. We've
55:57
got lines in the middle of fields of ball fields and parts of parking lots.
56:03
So, it's been great to work with Danny and Brett out there and kind of clean this up. So what we would be uh
56:10
proposing in the initial hearing for the land swap again really is focused around item A and item H for a swap. If that
56:19
gets approved by both entities, we will then come to you with the 2080 agreement on how we're going to continue to share
56:26
this complex. So any any questions there that I can help with?
