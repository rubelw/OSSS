0:00
I'd
0:10
like to call the special meeting of the Dallas Center Grimes School Board to order. Roll call, please. Miss Wearman. Director Baker Curtis, Director
0:17
Dickinson, Director here, Director Mber, here
0:23
Director Mcn here, director here. Like to welcome our visitors. Is anyone
0:29
registered to speak this evening, Miss Hartman? No. Uh, moving along to item four, approval
0:36
of the agenda. Looking for a motion. Move to approve mcnace. Second. Menberg. Any discussion?
0:45
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Post. Same sign. I did skip two on
0:50
purpose. We don't do that in special meetings. Yeah. Just so if those of you
0:55
that are following along very diligently, I could I was getting I was ready to stand up. Odd looks. Yeah. Uh,
1:02
moving along to item five, presentation of bills. Looking for a motion. Move to approve Vanderbilt. Second. Wberg. Any
1:09
discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Oppos. Same sign. Motion carries. Uh,
1:17
item six, the consent agend agenda. Looking for a motion. Move to approve. Mcnace. Second. Vanderbeld. Any
1:24
discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I.
1:29
Post same sign. Motion carries. Okay. So tonight's special meeting rolls a little
1:35
different. So uh this was actually a request from the board members from last year. Uh so the next two items really
1:41
are the uh go at the heart of that request. And so uh there's an eval
1:46
evaluatory process that the board goes through relative to superintendent and and uh and the board goals that we
1:53
approve every fall. So, um, Dr. Krenza is going to spend a little bit more time, uh, tonight talking about the
1:59
district goal set and kind of, uh, what the district accomplished. This is a really great opportunity for us to review that, but then also celebrate all
2:06
the fantastic things that, uh, happened districtwide across Dallas Center Grimes. And then, uh, the next agenda
2:12
item, Dr. Bloom, we'll spend some time looking at the two, uh, board goals that we had, um, this year, and then we'll
2:19
get on to old business and new business. So, uh, Dr. Corenza. Okay. Okay. Well, thank you so much. This is exciting. I
2:25
think partially when we put this together, um I just had this feeling of we probably don't take enough time to
2:31
stop and reflect along the way about where we've been, but also how we've accomplished what we set out to do at
2:36
the start of the year and think back in summary and and uh Dr. Bloom led us this morning in a meeting looking back at
2:43
even one month's worth of accomplishments. This is really a look back at the whole school year. So, um please jump in and ask questions as we
2:50
go along. So, um, up on the screen you can see, oh, maybe I got to turn this on first. There we go. Um, this is we're
2:57
going to talk about those school improvement goals that we set one year ago, um, for 2425. Those will be long
3:04
range and annual goals for our our district. Um, our building principles
3:09
will likely in June or have in May provided you some information on their progress towards their their building
3:15
goals. So, we're just focused on district right now. Um we're going to talk a little briefly about uh anti-bullying and harassment data and
3:22
then we'll look at just data reflections. So now that we see how we've performed, what what do we think
3:28
about that? Um this was just a slide that captured probably things that we've talked about even early in the year.
3:34
this idea of um this school year marked a chance for us to have greater
3:40
alignment between our district goals um and then what building goals were and possibly even teacher or individual
3:46
student goals before and it wasn't a bad thing but you know we saw random acts of improvement people all working um on
3:53
something important at their buildings but that alignment may not have been there I don't know Dr. Dr. Bloom, feel
3:58
free to add in. I think I felt that very much this year. A greater alignment. People were thinking about and
4:03
understanding how their actions, even down to the classroom level, support those district level goals. Um, this was
4:10
the year where we moved to every Wednesday early outs. So, that was paired with a lot of professional
4:15
learning that supported and targeted our our goals, excuse me. Um I I want to
4:20
give kudos to our curriculum team um and Shannon Olsen, our director of teaching and learning for leading that work of a
4:26
guaranteed and viable curriculum. So much bigger focus on ensuring that students that regardless of where they
4:31
go to our school, which school they go to, obviously it's mostly at the elementary level. Um but they all have
4:37
access to the same materials, the same instruction, the same amount of time to be able to learn that content and that's
4:43
been really important. And then just really looking at those high lever um tactics for us. PLC's are an important
4:50
way. It is really the way we need to operate. Um looking at data based decisionm just heard this morning from
4:56
our principles as they think about next year's goal. We heard a pretty common theme of let's get back to the data on a
5:02
more frequent basis so that we're making database decisions. And lastly our uh
5:07
introduction of the strong framework. So you saw four uh these are the long range
5:12
goals. We set them a year ago. So that's why they were five years set looking at May of 2029. And you can see we had
5:20
really four areas. Academics, academic support, climate and culture, and teacher efficacy. Broad headers. You can
5:27
see the goals specifically really focused on either a that we have opportunities for learning um when it
5:33
comes to ISAS that we have opportunities to increase proficiency. And so, uh, those I will not report on today because
5:39
again, five years from now. And we're seeing that our actions today and our actions next year are already starting
5:46
to help us get towards that goal. Um, and and I think that's probably for me the most exciting part is we're starting
5:53
to be able to clearly understand what it is we need to do as we enter the next school year. We're not just grabbing at
5:59
something. We're not trying to make it work. We're really sticking to these four areas.
6:04
Oops. Sorry. I'm There we go. Okay. So, we had short-term goals and again this
6:09
is the one that's for one year. So, basically by May of 2025
6:14
um we set out four steps in academics. We wanted to increase the percent proficient on ELA and math as measured
6:21
by the ISASP and proficiency is just one measure but we think right now where we're at as a district that's probably
6:27
our best measure is working to increase that percent proficient. I would um probably throw something out that in the
6:34
future in a couple of years as we keep increasing that percent proficient, we're going to start to turn more potentially to a student growth model.
6:41
How much are they growing? We still look at that, but we haven't ready we aren't ready for that as a goal yet. Um our
6:47
academic support was that we would have completed a study of best practices in MTSSA which is academics and B which is
6:54
behavior. So that when a student isn't successful, how do we respond? and uh
7:00
regardless of academics or behavior and we did a study of that. We'll walk through that and then those improving of
7:05
five percentage points in one or more topic areas on the conditions for learning survey which we administer here
7:11
in the district and then we'll look at teacher efficacy is how did we have provide opportunity to learn about the
7:16
strong framework. Greg quick question. So you said um back to the student
7:22
growth model and we're preparing for that to be a goal. What's kind of standing in the way of that today?
7:28
Um, I think it's probably learning from myself, learning for our administrative
7:34
team, uh, learning for our teachers about growth is really hard to predict. You get it once a year. Um, there's not
7:40
a lot of great measures to let me know if I'm really helping a student to grow. And so, right now in proficiency, right,
7:47
we could do some dipsticking along the way. We could do some um, assessments and testing to see if a student is
7:52
growing in their skills in terms of their proficiency. from a growth model is as we talked with the Iowa school
7:59
performance profile, proficiency is a it's a bit of a floor. It's a bit of a
8:04
low bar, right? We want to get proficiency on ISASP. Um, we definitely want to increase that percentage, but we
8:11
can have kids who are proficient but really aren't growing that expected one year or more growth in a year. They're
8:18
still proficient, which is a great measure for our state, but the Iowa school performance profile, as you remember, looks at both proficiency and
8:26
growth. It's just a bit more complicated um to calculate that. And I think we have some learning to do as an
8:31
administrative team. I would also add I think strong is going to be that framework that gets us to talking about
8:39
what does highquality instruction look like in our classrooms so that we aren't just putting kids through a pretty
8:45
traditional model. Um, we're working on when a kid isn't successful, a student isn't successful in the classroom, we're
8:52
working now on how are we going to respond? What are teachers going to do? How are we going to intervene? Um, this
8:59
next year, we're going to start looking at if they aren't successful, what is it we're doing? And the advanced students,
9:06
how will we continue to challenge our uh students that are already at or above that goal measure? And then I think
9:12
we'll start to be able to really dive down into looking at is a student making expected growth. So does that hopefully
9:19
that's Yeah it does. And then like if you think about then just the mechanisms to track that so data management systems
9:25
those types of do you have the tools that you need to be able to um once those
9:33
once the data is created do we have a a good way to manage the data and tell the story? I would offer up and and Dr.
9:39
room, please add in. We have access to tools. So, uh, right now the state
9:44
sponsors a program called EVOS. Don't dare ask me what that stands for, but it is a very high quality data management
9:52
tool where data gets, you know, input into the system through the state and through our student information system.
9:59
And we can see growth and we've already looked uh Austin Roy who's an assistant principal at the high school. he's led
10:05
our staff or administrative team and and just a very shallow preview of what that
10:11
data could give us. Um there are lots of other tools we have. Ryan, what I would
10:16
say is I think it's important that we have the tools, but we may need the human capital to be able to run that.
10:23
You do not want me running data. No, I'm just kidding. I we will run data. It would be very painful to watch me. It
10:29
would it's a very slow process. So I think as a board that would be something I'm I'm glad you asked that question
10:34
that I think some human capital of person who's dedicated to that service of of using data and not just for ISAS
10:42
by the way I mean we could do it for MTSS we could do it for fast we can do it for interventions
10:48
there'd be a ton of I think of in my time as a principal when I wanted data
10:53
and I knew it would take me a long time to be able to call somebody and say hey can you help me to collect this and
10:59
organize it in a meaningful Okay. Would be important and you had mentioned the principles want we want to get back to
11:04
databased decision methods. Would that revolve around kind of these tools you're speaking about? That's exactly I
11:11
um we know it's so important to get that data into their hands. Um IASP is tough
11:16
because it's once a year. Um a fast is three times a year uh fall, winter,
11:23
spring. So we have the ability to uh to you know to collect and dipstick as I
11:29
said where we're going. Um but things like in MTSS the multi-tered systems of
11:34
support buildings are desperately seeking an early warning system where they consider data in its totality to
11:41
look and say oh based on attendance based on grades based on um you know
11:46
behaviors we believe these students might be at risk for not being successful.
11:52
So they have these ideas in their head but probably um just aren't ready in
11:57
term of the skill set to get it programmed. I would use our TAG program as an analogy uh the work they did this
12:04
year through the Looker Studio which is a Google product um to be able to look at standard deviations and and our stu
12:11
our highest learners and see how far they are from the norm. And just the fact that in one push of a button,
12:18
right, we take our we take the Kogat assessment data, we take ISASP, we take fast, we take whatever data and we put
12:24
it into the Looker Studio and when programmed correctly in the push of a button, it gives us what we need. If I
12:31
was to do that, it would take me a couple of weeks by hand and some um highlighters, colored highlighters. That
12:38
that's just not efficient for us. We don't have that kind of time to be able to respond. So, um, I think you're
12:44
hitting exactly on probably something that we need to take care of in the short term. Yeah. And if it's if it's
12:49
okay, I add because I appreciate the question is we are probably at a two out of 10 with what we could and should do
12:56
with data. And it's because people are working on other stuff, right? No excuses, but they got other stuff.
13:02
They're not skilled yet. And Greg and I have talked at length about the desire
13:07
one day to add the human capital, not only for the district stuff that we're talking about, but we want the third
13:13
grade team at Heritage to be able to call and say, "Hey, we've talked about we want to look at our attendance and
13:18
how it matches up with this and have someone else dive in deep with them because they've got kids to worry about.
13:25
They got teaching to do." I we're missing the like this is just someone's baby to kind of be an expert and and
13:33
help us go from a two to an eight or a nine if not further. So yeah, and that's what I say is the tools are out there.
13:39
EVOS, Looker Studio, what was the one we paid for? Qualrix was the one we paid for many years ago. Um that does Tableau
13:46
Tableau. Yep. That is not the issue. We have people who can help us with that instantly. It's the manpower and the
13:53
time to be able to get that in there. Thanks. Yeah, thank you. So, um I'm I'm
13:59
not going to spend much time on this slide is this is what we presented to Sia at the February meeting. So, we just
14:05
gave some mid-year points of to like how were we doing in our progress towards that reading goal um reading and math,
14:12
excuse me. And it really result revolves around high quality curriculum and access to that curriculum trainings for
14:19
staff and then also the work that our Oakview and high school has done with our ESSA planning.
14:24
This is uh a very important slide here. I'm not going to read it to you. Hopefully, you've had a time to look at
14:30
as a board. But what we've done is um this is just English language arts for oops. Sorry. Sorry. There you go. I
14:36
should not be managing two. I'll just go from here. Um so the English language arts scores right there. As you can see,
14:42
when we're looking from fourth grade or third grade to fourth grade, we said kids in 4th through 11th. So you're
14:48
looking at that spring 2025 column. And we were wanting them to show an increase
14:53
in the percent proficient, even 1% more proficient um for our student body. And
14:59
this is cohort data. So plus or minus a few students that might have moved in, these are the same students from year to
15:06
year. So it's a good comparison for us. And you can see in four of those grade
15:11
levels, we did meet that goal in English language arts and some pretty incredible
15:16
um rates. So, if you're looking at our elementary looking at fourth grade um and even fifth and and into sixth, a 10%
15:23
growth at at um four at fourth grade this year, I think speaks to any number of things, including our curriculum. Our
15:30
teachers have done a great job of collaborating together to, you know, decrease that variation of what it looks
15:36
like in our classroom. Uh what you can see in there is, and it's very tiny. I want you to read it. Cover your left eye
15:41
and read the third row down. is um you should be able to see on your computers the percent that were proficient and the
15:47
percent advanced proficient. So you also have a comparison. It's not just enough to look at whether we increase or
15:54
decrease that percent proficiency. Also look at that advanced you know the proficient advance. So generally what we
16:00
tend to see uh is an increase in our advanced proficiency. not at every grade level, but but if anything, hopefully
16:06
we've maintained. Um, and I give that also credit to some of our increased TAG staffing and conversations they're
16:12
having with teachers around enrichment. Uh, we obviously had four grades that we did not meet that goal. It wasn't for
16:19
lack of trying. I always like to say in a system there is no blame. There's only the system to fix itself. And our system
16:24
is really working at looking next year as we go into professional learning communities and that datadriven
16:31
instruction. How can we continue to maintain um that growth for proficiency?
16:38
Here's our look at math. So, as you see here again, um three of our grade levels, they met that goal. Um five of
16:45
them they did not. Uh but again hopefully continuing to we didn't see quite the the amount of increases we did
16:52
in ELA but um math is I mean I don't
16:58
have direct answers as to why that is but I I do think we are in year two of a math curriculum review. So next year
17:05
we'll be looking at what curriculums we would either want to stay with, would we make a change that'll be a core part of
17:11
their work that'll also allow us to talk about tight and loose practices um around mathematics.
17:19
So just these are the end of year reflections. I'm going to highlight just a couple for you. So again, we're looking at that strong tier one
17:25
instruction. We would say that a school that has strong tier one has 80% of our students proficient on an assessment
17:32
like ISASP. And in many of our cases, if you I'm sorry, I'm going to back it up for one second. You can see Oh, maybe
17:39
there we go. Math. And so, ELA, I mean, 87%
17:46
87% 89%. Um, I I want to stop and recognize our teachers. That is an
17:53
indicica indicator of a very strong tier one. And a lot of places would give
17:58
anything to have scores like that. That doesn't mean we can't get better. Um what I think it's telling us is that um
18:05
when we increase the percent proficient and Ryan this kind of goes back to your question why we're focused on
18:10
proficiency now when we increase the percent proficient we have to intervene less right we have more time with fewer
18:17
students to have to intervene with those students are proficient in first hopefully go on to be proficient in
18:22
second our system remains strong as the years go along so same thing for math um
18:28
now we see tend to be a bit less proficient Um but we're in many cases we're nearing
18:34
80% or over that mark. So um this will be continue to be a growth area for us.
18:40
Um we need to continue with our PLC's and we'll talk about that later at the at our regular board meeting in June.
18:46
We'll be talking about district goals and then um just the ability to intervene um on a more regular basis,
18:52
what that looks like and then also PD around our student groups. So this is something you'll hear about later next
18:58
month. So I'll just give you a preview. But we really do when we dig down into the data, not just the surface level,
19:03
grade level proficiency, we notice that our student groups are the ones free and reduced, e, special education. Um, we've
19:11
seen that in our Iowa school performance profile. We need to be looking at specific methodologies and strategies we
19:17
can do to increase proficiency within those groups. And that's just I I think all districts probably are facing that.
19:24
Um, but that's definitely where we're at and the engagement of our students
19:30
So we did not meet that goal. Um and that's okay. There's lots of celebrations within that. Our second
19:37
goal was MTSS acade uh behaviors and academics. So this idea that we completed a study and best practice. So
19:44
those were those mid-year highlights from SCAK. I'm not going to go through that slide. Uh you can obviously read
19:49
about those things. Other than to say our addition of Emily Donovan to our um to our district as a consultant this
19:56
year has been really um helpful in getting um high quality information. She
20:02
was able to go out and look at our system and to give us really important feedback and we brought you that feedback at an earlier board meeting in
20:08
January maybe of this year. And so um we now feel like we can hit a target that we know we need to hit rather than just
20:14
guessing at it. Um this is just the proof. So when the next slide will say that we met the uh
20:21
standard or we met our goal. Uh there it is. We have laid out kind of those
20:26
things that happened. So we had some observations and interviews. We had our professional learning sessions. Those were once a month. Um and now where is
20:33
it? We started at halfway through the year. This next year we'll have nine months of learning. So I'm excited to see where that gets us. And then we have
20:40
a capacity matrix tool that uh teams complete. So we met that goal. and also
20:45
have visions for continued work. Um there's what I want to highlight is
20:51
in the bottom right hand corner. This was I think a really good work for our team, the MTSS team where we came back
20:57
and it's called an affinity diagram and it just helps us to prioritize. So many times people will say, "Oh gosh, if we
21:04
only had the people to intervene with the kids, we could do this." Or if we only had materials. Well, it's really
21:10
hard to know where do you start. So we know that if you just give them curriculum materials, it's not going to fix the situation. So we realize we have
21:17
to start with professional learning, which we've done this year and will continue next year. We have worked with our belief statements. What do we
21:23
believe about students and behavior? It's important for our district. How do we ensure consistency? There's the data
21:30
word, right? Um as we know, we need to start getting um more uh agile with
21:35
collecting and acting upon our data. And then MTSS process really defining what
21:40
that system is, what it looks like. Consistency. We have four elementaryaries. They all have their different flavor, but we also have to be
21:47
consistent on some pieces, too. And we heard about that today from our middle school um principal, Dr. Dodge. And just
21:54
this idea of when kids come to to Dallas Crimes Middle School, they're coming from four different places with four
22:00
different experiences with four differenti systems. And we know we just need to tighten that up so we can help
22:06
them to be successful. Uh really this is going to go fast. This
22:11
is a document you can zoom in on the picture and look at it. But um some of the best learning I think our team had
22:16
this year is when we think of this as a systems approach. Um as I said it's only the system to fix itself. And I love the
22:23
uh fire fighting a fire analogy. So I I only am going to show you three of the
22:28
of the five pictures that are up there. Where we've been was picture one, right?
22:34
our building principles, our staff that are in their buildings, they put out this fire, meaning a behavior situation
22:40
or an academic situation. Oops, the walkie-talkie goes off. Now I got to go down to this situation. I got to deal
22:46
with that. And then the whoop goes off and 20 minutes later, I'm over here with never a chance to be proactive. It
22:54
always feels reactive. Everyone's doing their best work, doing the best that they can, but we're just more reactive.
23:00
In the second picture, it kind of talks about we're starting to get a general sense of um organization and systems
23:07
thinking. Then you go to this third uh picture, which is systemic evaluation,
23:12
improvement. So, we're going to start to look at what are those hot spots, as we would say, what are those pressure
23:17
points in our buildings with regards to MTSS we really should act upon. So they might say, "Oh, at the middle school,"
23:23
and I'm I'm just using this as an example. Um Oak View or the middle school might say, "Oh, we can reasonably
23:29
suspect the bus line, buses, bus transportation, stairwells, and
23:36
bathrooms, and locker bays are going to be areas where we see the most behaviors. So, we're starting to look at
23:42
and collect that data. What are we seeing based on referrals? And how can we start to plan our response?" Ah, I
23:48
need to put staff in the locker bay. I need to have more staff on duty at the bus. I need to, you know, communicate
23:54
more with with Jeff Wolf or however it might be. We're going to start to be more responsive.
24:00
Um, picture four talks about then a fire extinguisher or a fire suppression
24:05
system, right? So then you use that information to start to plan. You're using data to say, "Oh gosh, I'm going
24:12
to I'm going to have a sprinkler head over there. I have a sprinkler head here. Probably one right above my head."
24:17
So when something happens, right, we're we're efficient, we're effective, we have a process, and we can respond to
24:23
that fire, so to speak, in that analogy. Step five and the final is this idea of
24:29
organizational analysis and innovation. I love this um using we're going to we're going to be so proactive. We're
24:36
going to use fire retardant materials and protection. So we're going to in this case, we're going to pre-teach students what behavior looks like and
24:43
and good behavior. We're going to model with our staff. We're going to recognize the positive. We're going to be
24:49
proactive so that the fires never happen. And I and I think this is a great drawing and and feel free Dr.
24:55
Bloom to to comment. I think this was a a hook for our staff to understand what
25:00
what it is we're trying to do with behaviors.
25:07
Um goal three, right, was conditions for learning uh survey. You may have
25:13
received something um asking to opt in for your children to participate. Um
25:19
that's with our new state laws around surveys and asking about well-being. So
25:24
um this was a survey we had to have parents opt in. We tried some methods at parent teacher conferences. Um AJ did an
25:31
amazing job with parent square. Um our participation uh what was the district the all district it was 54
25:38
56 something like that. um total. So let's keep that there for
25:44
just a minute of remembering that 54% of our students took this survey. In the past when it was required by the state,
25:51
we obviously would have had oh probably 99% of our students take it. Students could always opt out but what's
25:58
challenging is now you have to opt in. So those are the categories by which they assess climate and culture in a
26:05
building. These are the results. So, we did not meet our goal, which was an increase of of one um at least five
26:12
percentage points in one or more of those areas. Um you can see across the
26:18
chart there um it just varies. In some buildings, they would see um a decrease.
26:25
This assessment or this survey is a bit challenging. Um, it's a really quality
26:31
tool in that we actually have longitudinal data from the last five years for the state or for the district.
26:38
The tool also allows us to look at how did our schools perform in relation to all schools in H Heartland Aea area, so
26:46
central Iowa, and how did we compare in relation to the state?
26:52
But it's fair to ask, well, when only 54%. I have to uh AJ did such a great
26:58
job of getting me the percentages uh by building and I just I think it might be
27:03
helpful. Here we go. Um so, for example, uh
27:09
one building might have had uh Oakview 54% of the students opted in. Um our
27:15
highest building was heritage was 73%. Well, do we believe while that may be
27:21
and likely is a representative sample by chance because we don't we know who opted in, but we're not it's it's um
27:28
anonymous data, so we don't know what the students put. But if would we say that it's it's that's a high enough
27:35
participation rate for us to feel good about the data that we received? I don't know. That's kind of a hard question to
27:41
answer. Um, I would say that we put out surveys here uh as a district to parents
27:47
on a variety of topics and we don't have always 100% or even 70% or 50%
27:53
participation. Yet, we make decisions based off of the the information that we do get. So, I please don't hear me say I
28:00
I'm negating conditions for learning. I think it's one piece that you have to consider in a bigger puzzle. Um, but you
28:07
can see we did not meet that goal. some some one of our buildings is very very scores very very high. So to see a 5%
28:14
increase, we probably didn't think of that at the time we wrote the goal. Um I also am not sure. We talked as an
28:21
administrative team today about whether or not we want to continue with this and I think the consensus is we will kind of
28:28
recraft the goal and stay with conditions for learning for one more year next year but then we'll also look
28:35
at what other survey options might be there for us. The downside is we're
28:40
going to have to start all over at our data collection. We're going to have to get some baseline data. The good news is we may find a tool that just um meets a
28:47
little bit more of what we're expecting. But also, even if we switch tools, the state will still require because it's
28:54
not a statemandated survey, it will still require parents to opt in. But I
28:59
think it'll give us more time to be proactive. if they opt in at any point in the year or perhaps through our
29:05
registration process, maybe we'll have more people be interested in participating. So, I think there was some disappointment that more people
29:12
didn't participate. Yeah. And I just I just want to add I think if you know after this next year, yeah, we'll we'll
29:17
look into different survey options that potentially can be tailored more to what
29:22
our DCG conditions for learning are statewide. these these are the questions
29:28
which which they're good but we can maybe tailor some more to what we're looking to tackle and potentially do
29:33
them more than once. We give the conditions for learning survey in May, right? April and May. No excuses, but
29:40
it's one time. It's towards the end of the year where let's find a survey that we can see how our kids are doing
29:47
November, February and May, you know, let's not just do it once once a year. And end of the year can be really
29:52
tricky. We've just given fast assessments. We've given ISAP assessments and now we're giving
29:58
conditions for learning. People have a little bit of fatigue from all of those assessments. I'm not using that as an
30:03
excuse. I'm just saying it's a reality for us versus if we could do it multiple times in
30:16
Yeah. Yeah. when we're asking them, correct? When we're asking them to take one step, even if it's just a hey, click
30:22
here and say yes, it's just one more thing that can get lost when you're looking at multiple emails. So, that's a great point. Um, moving on. So, these
30:30
are just our reflections. We've already talked about all of this. Um, but please remember, we also did do a parent survey
30:35
and a staff survey for most of the buildings. Um, that was done through Google um uh Google Forms because the
30:42
state does not give us that in Panorama anymore. Um, so we have we have some work to go in this area.
30:50
Last goal was teacher efficacy. So the seven indicators, did we have a chance to provide all of that? We had our
30:56
midyear updates. Um, we had great support from Carol Pollock at with Strong and Associates. Um, she's one of
31:02
their um um facilitators. She's helped us a lot. Had a great chance uh to work with our teacher quality committee
31:08
through what we're doing. This was the list of the dates. So, as you can see, we cover all of the seven standards. It
31:14
was just a learning year for us, but you can see that we were we hit a really great cadence. This is where I I think
31:21
I've shared with you our instructional coaches and our building principles were the they are the ones that delivered
31:26
that strong framework. Um the district created that presentation. We trained them in it. They delivered it. It was a
31:32
great model for us. So I'm thankful for their help. So before I go on to bullying action
31:38
questions that you have about the data that around our
31:46
okay if you think of them shout them out uh anti-bullying and harassment efforts.
31:51
So um this is this is a this is the 2425 school year. So you will see um we have
31:59
really five terms that we use with cases. You're either under investigation, which obviously we've
32:05
wrapped all of those up. Um, you're either we have could have founded cases, those that met the definition uh for
32:12
bullying and harassment is defined by the state. Unfounded, paused. We had
32:17
several during the year. If you would have checked with me in January, February, we might have paused a couple simply because we didn't have enough
32:23
information. The students really weren't giving us what we needed. So, we might pause to see if it finally remedyed
32:30
itself. But we clear those all up and either decide founded or unfounded. Or in some of our cases, we terminate them.
32:37
Meaning the the child or a parent might say, "Oh, we wish to take that back. That wasn't what we wanted how we wanted
32:43
to handle it." Or um maybe um false information was given. Maybe somebody
32:50
moved out of district. There could be any reasons why we terminate a case. So 38 total. These now remind you these are
32:56
formal. So meaning they were submitted through the district website. This doesn't count all of the ones where a
33:01
principal or a teacher may or counselor may have addressed them down in the building. I, as you know, I'm just
33:07
biased, but I'm pretty proud of this effort. I think if you think back to several years ago, we were reporting one
33:13
as a whole year total. One, two, I think three was about the highest I saw of of
33:19
founded cases. Feel like we're being more intentional. Our staff have done an excellent job of um uh supporting
33:26
students in that moment, working with uh Gail, our bullying invest uh bullying and harassment investigator externally
33:33
um and have had a lot of positive feedback. As we look ahead to next year, we're already signing up all of our
33:40
employee groups, student groups for bullying and harassment trainings next year as well.
33:46
Um I have a couple questions about this slide. Sorry. Um, so the ones that are unfounded, are those just obviously you
33:53
guys have done the investigation and it doesn't qualify due to like the state
33:59
definition, but is that then handled inhouse like with the principal? Because obviously there's still an issue, right?
34:05
It might not be formal bullying, but isn't does that get handed back to the principal to address? Well, yes, it is
34:12
from a monitoring standpoint. So, we would say we we've investigated the situation. Uh remember uh in our
34:18
definitions we have bullying and then there's conflict. Probably a lot of those unfounded were conflict. Kids that
34:25
it didn't meet the whole um it didn't meet the state's definition. Um you know reasonably placing kids in fear of harm,
34:32
preventing them from coming to school, the the characteristics by which it it could happen. Um, so what we I think the
34:39
wording we use is while it does not meet the standard uh definition for the state for bullying and harassment, the case
34:46
remains under investigation. Um, so meaning uh Dr. Bloom and I um have a
34:52
conflict at school, Shaylee investigates, it was determined that it was a
34:57
conflict, but um that would not stop Shaylee from putting in a safety plan.
35:03
That that could happen founded or unfounded. It could mean slight changes. Uh maybe Dr. Bloom and I now have
35:09
different schedules so that we don't, you know, encounter each other in the hallway. Might be informal check-ins. Uh
35:15
you name it. And it could just be we've told them to stop and they've stopped. Uh I mean that does happen. Not often,
35:22
but it does happen in a good way. So perfect. Great. And then one more question. The district there says
35:29
there's two Oh, yeah. What's that buses? Uh yeah. Yeah, that that would be
35:37
could be in activities. I do not believe we actually didn't have any activities this year. I'm really that's that was a
35:42
good area for us. But I believe both of those were transportation. I could be wrong, but I know one of them for sure
35:48
is. Um it could be um yeah, activities, transportation. Would I be missing
35:54
anything that could be I just think Monica was curious. Was there actually an investigation between us? I do hope.
36:00
I think she was like that a real example. Shay actually. Yeah. I go down the north
36:08
hallway here and this way he only came. We actually had to switch offices. It's kind of uncomfortable. Yeah. Yeah. And
36:13
we have to sign up for a time to use the copier. It works though. It's fine. So no. Um glad you guys have figured it
36:19
out. Yeah, we figured it out. But yeah, that's a great um remember this our policy right now extends to volunteers
36:26
and students. So I mean there it could be a number of different it could staff could be involved. But thank you. Yeah.
36:32
Thank you. And you can when you look at that, we know where the most concentration of our issues um or our
36:38
cases are going to be. Uh I'm really proud of of those buildings. Uh Oak View is a shining example, too, of having
36:44
just tackled the problems head-on and been really proactive um working with students. Um our elementaryaries just
36:51
don't see much of that. And sorry, I'm I'm slowing things down now, but I'm going to give all of our
36:56
principles, teachers, Greg a huge shout out because I mean, first of all, the transparency and openness. What did you
37:03
say again this morning? I think three, four, five years ago, our
37:08
reported numbers of investigations were two, one, and one.
37:16
Probably more than that was going on. So the fact that like we're just owning it and then a perfect ex this is a perfect
37:22
example of the the fire analogy that Greg shared this is us doing the work in
37:29
the system but we're meeting with all the grade levels the coaches the bus drivers going over our expectations what
37:36
are you looking for talking to kids about how to report like so we're
37:41
responding appropriately but also out in front with how we want your behavior to be how can you be a good friend if find
37:49
a trusted adult like I think we're we're doing solid on both ends and I won't bring this up here but we will talk in
37:55
the future probably maybe August around August around some really cool things we want to try now with bowling idea again
38:01
a a parent committee we've had a lot of interest of people who just want to learn and see how they can help the district we've thought about having peer
38:07
trainers so allowing students to go and peer train peers I mean there's nothing if you're an elementary kid more than
38:13
you want to see a high schooler or an Oakview kid come and present to you because it could be a sibling they look
38:18
up to those kids. So, are there ways that we can take it from adults always doing it to also letting kids do some of
38:24
that work. It's just going to take us a little bit of time because again, we've got lots of other jobs, too. But I think
38:29
there's some exciting things ahead. And that's it.
38:37
Thank you very much. Any questions before we move on to Dr. Bloom?
38:42
Great work. Thanks a bunch. Thank you.
38:48
Dr. Bloom. Okay. Thanks, AJ. Um, real quick, as Greg alluded to, we we had the
38:55
um admin team get together today and we got to have our outgoing principles and
39:01
and director Rocks sit alongside our incoming. So, we had um our two um new
39:08
principles come in and then we had Madison was here with us and then our
39:13
new director, Alison. So, it was just neat that we were kind of reflecting on the year, but also kicking off next
39:19
year. And we spent some time talking about leadership and what it looks like and
39:24
spent spent some time really saying, you know, there there's not a scenario in leadership where you did it by yourself
39:32
like you were the leader that did X, Y, and Z. That it's a shared deal across
39:37
the board. And the and the goals that I got to have with you guys that I'm going to go through here here
39:43
fairly quickly is 100% credit to the entire team that does this work. So I
39:50
just want it is perfect timing for our work this morning to kind of share out um our progress with our our district
39:57
kind of superintendent goals. So first goal was around our strategic plan. So you know it's been a long time if ever
40:05
that DCG's had a strategic plan. So, we uh we hit the ground running here and I remember back all the way in probably
40:12
June or July, Greg and I met with uh several uh businesses and organizations
40:17
and ultimately settled on Teamworks and and Julie who's done a a great job for us. But, you know, it's to develop and
40:24
implement the district-wide strategic plan um with the goals of you know, academic, operational, and community uh
40:31
over the next three years and ensuring continuous improvement. And so I want to get into kind of the steps that we've
40:37
taken throughout the year again starting last summer. And all the credit goes to
40:42
this group and more. So tough to see maybe at home in here, but this is the
40:48
strategic planning team that met starting in September 8, nine, 10 times this year. a nice
40:56
cross-section um throughout our district of different positions, admin, teachers,
41:01
associates, e, special education, preschool, across the board. So, this
41:06
was the dedicated team that spent numerous hours meeting together in
41:12
person, doing stuff behind the scenes, participating, helped move the needle with our surveys. So I just want to give
41:19
this group um all the credit in the world because they are the ones that are again doing the hard work, giving the
41:24
feedback, meeting with their peers to learn more. So this was an awesome group
41:30
to be a part of. So just a reminder of kind of the process. So again, we started back in
41:36
June with the initial design of what what was our goals and where we're headed, what do we want out of this, and
41:42
then with Julie and teamworks leadership, um we we walk through a number of steps. So we, you know, had
41:50
the very beginning orientation with the strategic planning team and ultimately with our board members of what again,
41:56
what are we looking for, what's what's working, what are we celebrating, what are the holes. Um so we did that. One of
42:03
the neat things we did was that story wall where we brought in community members and business partners and we
42:09
went all the way back the history of DCG and kind of looked at all the neat things that were happening in kind of
42:15
time periods and highlight and celebrated those but then also you know let's be progressive and look forward as
42:21
well. So that was um really neat. Then we got into a lot of our uh surveys with
42:27
our families and staff. I think we sent out um four or five surveys to all of our stakeholders over the course of the
42:34
strategic plan. So, we feel really good that you've had an opportunity to have a
42:39
voice throughout this process, no matter what hat uh you wear and and multiple opportunities for that. So, that's where
42:46
we came up with those daily desired daily experiences. What what as a student, as a as a educator, as a
42:53
parent, what do you want life at DCG to look like? So, we built those kind of in
42:58
that that late fall. Um, and then we got into a little bit more of the action, the classroom theory of action draft.
43:05
This is what how are we going to take these daily desired experiences and actually turn them into something
43:10
productive, visible, tangible. So, we did that kind of into the the winter time. At the same time, we did our
43:17
strengths and needs assessment of our entire all of our seven buildings and
43:22
all of our departments. So again, back to survey results, but we then also went around and talked to each other. So here
43:29
comes building leadership teams and and they're talking the building leadership team from Northridge is talking to
43:35
transportation about all the great things they're doing, but maybe some questions they've got and then they're going to operations department and then
43:42
they're going to human resources. So we kind of got to see everybody's strengths and areas of growth from each other,
43:50
which was uh really cool. you guys have been involved in this process at various times, right? We we kind of took some of
43:56
the the classroom stuff we're doing. Well, then now where's the governance part of this? So, that's when Julie kind
44:01
of brought you back in the loop to talk about, you know, what truly is going to be the school board's role in a
44:06
strategic planning process. Um, and then kind of now it's the new
44:12
year. It's January of 25 and we're really starting to put some pencil to
44:17
paper of the three-year operational plan. Back in uh kind of February before spring break, uh the process was a
44:24
vision card development. This is really going to lead into the action cards. That is our kind of final steps that
44:30
we'll get to later in the summer and then into next school year. But again,
44:35
all of that input, all of those variety of of stakeholder voices and then the
44:40
meetings we've had are leading to actual kind of bullet points of what we want to tackle. Um, again, then we got the road
44:48
map out. We got those surveys going and then, uh, back in April is when we really started to kind of have the
44:55
initial example of what an action card was going to be. So, if we're going to focus on um taking the next step with
45:02
AI, well, there's going to be an action card that goes with that and says, what are we going to accomplish? What are the
45:08
steps? Who's going to own that work? Right? So, we literally can go back to that action card and say, thumbs up,
45:15
we're kicking butt here or we're not there yet. What are we missing? Readjust. So, we're act there's going to
45:20
be physical um kind of documentations we can have for that. And then in a couple
45:26
weeks, u we're kind of doing the the final look at the governance plan with you, the board, in our work session on
45:32
the 24th. Um eventually then we'll hopefully get all of that approved and
45:37
then we will see the kind of quote unquote final version of the three-year
45:42
strategic plan knowing on purpose it's a working continuous document that is always livable. Um, so I mean it's it
45:51
was a full 12 months worth of work and and still going and you know when I was
45:57
reflecting on on this goal for me personally and if you said you know where are you on this goal I I put you
46:03
know I'm I'm effective because this was just the learning and the groundwork and
46:09
now the real work of actually doing the things we're going to do is next. So
46:15
can't be highly effective in my opinion. And I haven't we did what we've asked to do and I think it's good work here but
46:20
the the real stuff is coming. So hopefully we can show highly effectiveness in years to come.
46:29
So this is the actual road map um again that we worked on in in a lot of voices
46:34
and this is where it goes back to you know kind of looking at our new district mission empowering every student to create their future and then the vision
46:41
for that. Our district strives for excellence through innovation and embrace growth in every dimension of education.
46:47
And then we talk about our core values. You know, what does it mean to be a Mustang? Where where what are our words?
46:53
What are our actions? We talked about collaborative, passionate, inclusive, innovative, and supportive. And then
46:58
that bottom part, this is what you'll really see come to life in the three-year strategic plan. um the kind
47:06
of A through E, we will start to bring these items to life and you'll see kind
47:12
of again back to those action cards and how they will fall back to kind of one of these categories. And I put on here
47:17
for you, this is 100% just a rough example. This is not the actual
47:23
document, but you can see strategic direction A. There will be five of those, right? There will be five
47:30
different things that we tackle with each one of these having three separate columns of learning work, implementation
47:36
work, and imple implementation work change management and then over the course of three years. So hopefully we
47:43
knock out a good chunk of 25 and 26. If not, it gets rolled over to 26 27 and
47:50
then we just add that column right into 28 29. what is we will always be working
47:56
with that three-year strategic plan hopefully crossing things off tweaking adding
48:01
etc but you know there's teaching and learning right we're going to have operations we've got HR so we are
48:07
hitting all the big key concepts and what was really neat about both of these goals as I as I flip to facilities here
48:14
in a second is to you know for me personally to play a tiny tiny role in both of these to really do strategic
48:20
plan and think about the impact you're going to have inside the classroom the with the environment of our building and
48:26
really the this is why you want to come to DCG and see and feel awesome stuff
48:31
like that's kind of the instruction part, the teaching part and then to be a small part of the facilities piece too
48:37
where it's like we're keeping our people safe, right? We're being innovative with how we use our spaces and we're thinking
48:43
long term with uh hopefully future growth and how to again best utilize um
48:48
our fiscal responsibility with upcoming bonds. It's really neat to kind of play a role in both kind of instruction world
48:55
and facility world. So, this is the document that you'll kind of see behind
49:01
the scenes um that Greg and I and team will continue to then keep you updated in future board meetings with really how
49:08
are we doing on our strategic plan. So, super cool process for me to be a part of. And again, uh Juliet at Teamworks
49:16
has been amazing. The admin team here is awesome, but I I just can't share enough
49:21
about the the team that you saw giving up time out of their classrooms and out of their jobs to be a voice for their
49:27
colleagues and peers and wearing parent hats and community member hats. It's been a lot of fun. So, Scott, I'm going
49:34
to make an assumption that the other four cards are going to be Well, I mean, it appears to me that this
49:41
is pretty rigorous in terms of action. If you just look at 25 26
49:47
And then if you think that there's you know kind of that four 4x this Yeah.
49:53
How are you feeling just in term I mean first I think it's very reasonable that the board would consider this as a
50:00
continuation goal you know for the next several years and um so reasonably if
50:08
we're going to put this much time and effort into it I think it's it's probably reasonable for the g the goal
50:13
of the board to continue the uh goal expectation around this but y if we just
50:19
if you just think about the resourcing um requirement to to do this. Do you
50:25
feel like and I know we've got kind of items 13 through 15 yet to do here in June and July and August. So maybe we're
50:32
not completely vetted on this, but how are you feeling about that? If this is,
50:38
you know, kind of these five cards, the the board approves a goal 25 26
50:45
then, you know, kind of then execution against all these items. Y how you
50:50
feeling about that? So great question. I today I think we are ambitious but
50:56
understanding when the day-to-day stuff comes to this may be a little bit
51:02
more than we can you know chew in real life but we want to see knowing we can
51:10
can move and adjust the the the thing that I think is very helpful with this is naturally team they kind of funnel to
51:18
certain people. I get to have my hands in all of it which is fun but like embracing academic process and resource.
51:24
Well, that's going to be led by Greg and the teaching and learning team of Shana and then Allison, right? Well, then we
51:30
talk about investing in a workforce. Well, that's going to be led by Carrie and then we'll all support Carrie. Like,
51:36
no one's in this alone. Um, improving our learning environment, systems and operations. Well, I'll get to do some
51:42
neat stuff with Travis and Sean. So, like there's a lot, but I also think
51:48
it's it's going to be dividable, if that's a word, that each one of those folks can kind of take the lead and we
51:54
can surround them and support each other to help our teachers and kids. But I could very easily be coming to you in
52:01
March saying it was ambitious. We'd rather, of course, come and say we
52:06
did these at a very high level and push these to next year than to be like here,
52:11
here's 30 things we did at a C minus for you. So, I don't think we'd put it on there if we don't think it's doable, but
52:18
we understand it's living and breathing on purpose that if we don't get to the AI stuff that we've got planned because
52:25
this priority jumped in front, then AI gets to slide over and it's not going to
52:31
be a race forever. It's just going to move to the next year or whatever. So I
52:37
think too for me when I was thinking the same thing, Ryan, when I look at you as kind of the CEO of the district, I would
52:42
almost kind of put the ball in your court of saying what do you think with the team is important. Um because I'd
52:49
rather get 80 90% of some very measurable things, but then I think too
52:54
for us as a board, a lot of these goals, how are we going to define success in each one? And so then maybe making them
53:02
less I mean just to be honest and then how do we define success in each one sure um because then obviously if we
53:08
can't measure it you know some of them are kind of broad so kind of developing the plus 5% or whatever something like
53:15
that I think pairing that down especially when you think about doing it year one what can we actually accomplish
53:21
and then how can we empower the team set measurable goals for each and then divide that down across the organization
53:27
I think will be um you making those calls calls of what you think because obviously there's a billion other things
53:32
the teachers and the principles can do um but these are extremely important. So yeah, no great input.
53:40
Any other questions about kind of the strategic plan? So what what's left is right our our work session ultimately
53:46
kind of the governance piece of that and then our team will really start to get
53:52
after the what's going to kind of make this list for next year and beyond. what's going to be researched versus what's going to get implemented. The the
54:00
work change management means we're we're doing it already. We're just going to monitor it and just do it a little better. So, um that's what's next for us
54:07
this summer and then into the start of school. Okay. And then uh goal number two was
54:15
around a facilities master plan. again something I hadn't got to be a part of until this job and it's been just super
54:21
fascinating to to learn from the experts and you know how does it tie in with RSP
54:27
who we heard from last month and demographics to the facilities piece to having a vision but taking care of
54:33
existing buildings it's just been a lot of fun so our goal was to develop and implement a comprehensive districtwide
54:38
facilities master plan to address current and future needs and this will come out uh later in the summer when OPN
54:45
is final finalized their 10-year plan. So, we will get a a big document, a big
54:51
booklet, but a essentially a 10-year priority list that again we can move up and down based on a number of factors,
54:58
but we again literally will have a document that we can say in our 10-year plan, here is our plan to address these
55:05
things. We're not guessing, we're not hoping. It is a living, breathing document, which is exciting. Um, again,
55:12
credit to everybody that makes up and there's there's a ton, but you know, our
55:17
group played a little bit of a role in it for sure. Um, OPN is our architects.
55:23
They they've been just fantastic partners. They utilize Bishop and Modus Engineering who we used in other
55:29
capacities. They've been great. And then DCI is our construction management. So, to have the, you know, the architects do
55:36
their thing, engineers do theirs, here comes DCI that kind of shares their expertise. Michelle tells him to slow
55:42
down. We got to pay for that. You know, it's been a great balance of everybody working together. But, uh, a wonderful
55:48
team. And then who I should have put on here is the over the last four or five
55:54
months, the kind of district facilities team where we had those community members come in. Like, what an awesome group of parents, business leaders,
56:02
coaches, teachers. I mean just an awesome group that uh you know wants to
56:07
pass this bond and more importantly just do really neat things for our kids and and staff. So the process that when when
56:14
we get this final document here in a couple months so OPN did a facility
56:19
analysis. So they literally looked at the physical uh structures of every building inside and out. You know how
56:25
were things working from mechanical to structures to all that stuff. They also did an educational assessment. So they
56:31
met with every building principal, toured every building with them. Sometimes they had some building leadership team and they wanted to
56:36
understand like how do you use this space today? Do you want to use it that way in the future? What if you did this?
56:42
They they kind of talked school with them in the eyes of facilities, right? How can we use things differently
56:48
better? Um then they started to put their concept design and project development. So this is really when our
56:54
group started to get together as a district facilities team and they said, "Hey, we've done our our analysis, done
57:02
our educational assessment. Here's what we believe are the needs if we they kind of started to prioritize
57:08
for us health and well-being and then safety
57:13
and then you know capacity. they really started to talk shop about where things
57:19
need to fall kind of on this priority list and that's when they started working with our our our team in the
57:25
evenings there and then ultimately what we will see is a 10-year again master facility plan. So I'll let you read this
57:32
but again here was just some highlights of their comprehensive physical uh analysis. So again they looked at
57:38
just all the equipment both mechanical plumbing interior exterior security systems our technology um so again the
57:47
physical items they spent a lot of time with in each one of our school buildings
57:53
and then um the educational assessment. So this is when they again looked at the layouts. They toured the building to
57:59
learn about different programs we've got in different buildings. um learned about grade configurations.
58:07
How are you is it is it working to where you have your teachers located when they're in teams? Um what are some
58:13
constraints? Some some issues and again just kind of the site as a whole um and
58:18
and they're learning daily operations. So where do your where do your buses drop kids off of? Is that affected? Do
58:24
you see any security safety concerns? They had all of those talks kind of schoolwise um with each one of our
58:31
principles in the building which was very neat. And then this is the part where they met with um the facilities
58:38
team and again went through different priority lists. They've you know the the high school kind of needs the main
58:44
attention there about at capacity. So we started looking at different options of renovation and building and adding
58:52
classrooms and redoing things. Um, but then also still paying attention to other buildings. We know we got to get
58:58
some security measures in in the main entrances at uh the middle school, Dallas Center Elementary, and
59:04
Northridge. That's that's got to be on our list at the top, right? And just so they have kind of the big chunk of high
59:10
school stuff, but also how do we still work in all these other things that we found in our assessments. So, um, really
59:16
neat. We're excited to share that with the board here soon as we kind of narrow down what those plans are and what those
59:22
timelines are. But all part of this facilities work that has been super fun for me to be a part of.
59:29
So questions on maybe that that piece of the goal.
59:34
Well, first thanks for working through this. I mean, it's um it's always been,
59:41
I think, difficult for me to understand how how Michelle was able to effectively
59:47
uh do capital planning, particularly around the care and feeding pieces around the build infrastructure that we
59:53
have. I mean, until this point, I don't think we had any life cycle based um you
59:59
know, kind of capital demand markers across the next number of years. And so it's certainly my first time on on the
1:00:05
board where you know we we actually can can look at that. It's a huge spend category and we all know that um you
1:00:13
know the um we we try to leverage Pebble, we try to leverage bond dollars and you know there's a few funding
1:00:18
mechanisms in there but uh this is this is really important uh from from that
1:00:24
perspective. And then kind of part B to that is then you know all right what's kind of the net new needs that aren't
1:00:30
built yet, right? And then how do we keep you know certainly a look at deferred maintenance and stuff that we
1:00:36
need to catch up on and then once that's done what's kind of our annualized demand based on life cycle stuff plus
1:00:43
then how do we keep a little bit of financial powder dry to be able to go executing that new stuff. So exactly I
1:00:49
think this puts the district in a in a much better place because we can kind of look at the whole picture. Yep. Uh for
1:00:55
the first time and for me anyway that's really helpful. So thanks thanks for your work here. Yeah.
1:01:02
Any other facilities questions or feedback? And then I'll go to the last piece here.
1:01:08
Okay. So, we sent out the Qualric survey. Um, you know, kind of towards
1:01:14
the end of the year for staff and we had them ask 30 30-ish questions or so. You
1:01:21
know, kind of Carrie and AJ kind of led this work and Qualrix has been great. We are at talk about step two of 10 like we
1:01:29
just got Quicks a couple weeks ago and we've got a lot of learning and they're going to we can do some neat stuff there but we at least wanted to use them and
1:01:37
they were able to give feedback on uh district items me personally building principles climate and culture. A lot of
1:01:43
fun questions. So we'll dive into and have more on that. But I just wanted to as part of my presentation ahead of my
1:01:49
evaluation just share at least the the questions publicly that were specific to me with this and and what we asked uh
1:01:57
folks to that filled out is is just three questions related to their job. They either put they were an associate,
1:02:03
they were certified teacher or other, right? So they were again a bus driver, custodian, an administrator. So those
1:02:10
were the um the three options that so we don't want to obviously we wanted this to be anonymous and the other thing that
1:02:17
we we did ask is what building are you attached to because when there are some
1:02:22
specific questions that get into like your manager right we just at least want to be able to identify
1:02:29
building strengths and goal areas as well as I meet with uh principles and do their evaluations in the next couple
1:02:35
weeks. So we'll get to all that down the road. for me. Um, I'll just I'll go quickly here for everybody,
1:02:42
but uh, Dr. Bloom is a is a great partner in the work happening in my building. Um, see here, we're roughly
1:02:50
330 people filled out this this survey and, you know, just kind of putting into
1:02:55
two groups very quickly. um rough math there, right? Was about 93 or 4% agreed
1:03:02
in some capacity with that and about six 7% disagreed with that.
1:03:11
Uh I'm confident in Dr. Bloom's ability to represent DCG on a on a local and statewide scale.
1:03:17
Again, you're in I don't know if I should just be reading numbers. just feels awkward. But, uh, 93ish% and in
1:03:22
about 6%, you know, that's, you know, obviously going to be able to grow in all of these hopefully. But it's it's
1:03:29
nice to know that, you know, I care much about DCG and public schools that hopefully I'm able to represent us
1:03:36
across the board and and brag about us and help us out being loud and noisy when I
1:03:42
need to though. As well, Dr. Bloom has my best interest in mind. So about, you
1:03:47
know, 91ish% of folks agree with that statement. About 9% disagree.
1:03:55
I can approach Bloom with uh joys and concerns. I appreciate this one a lot
1:04:01
too. Just want to make sure I'm an open door. Um no matter what title I have, and looks like 95ish, 96% or so agree
1:04:10
that they can approach me with joys and concerns. About 4% disagree.
1:04:15
effective communicator. Um certainly a very important one. 95ish percent agree with that and about 5%
1:04:23
disagree. Visible and accessible. Um certainly
1:04:28
want to be I I am not very high in myself this year. I did not get a do a good enough job of being visible in
1:04:35
classrooms and buildings. I I need to uh improve on that one again. But n looks
1:04:40
like 90 or so percent said they agree visible and accessible and about 10%
1:04:46
disagree. And the last question that at least had somewhat of a connection I believe that
1:04:52
the changes we've seen during the 2425 school year and this again credit to
1:04:58
tons and tons of people. Um, but you know, we we made some big changes this year and I hope a lot were felt
1:05:03
positively and at least 330 or so people say, you know, 92ish%
1:05:11
say positive changes throughout and about 78% said no. So again, not
1:05:18
specifically tied to a goal, but since we had that data, I wanted to make sure the board ahead of your evaluation had
1:05:24
at least the questions that directly involved me and those folks watching at home are access this, they can they can
1:05:31
see the the raw numbers for themselves. So, lots to celebrate and certainly
1:05:37
areas to continue to improve and look forward to doing both. So
1:05:43
with that, that's my little presentation and I am up for any questions, but I
1:05:48
just want to thank the again I I am a tiny tiny piece and all the
1:05:54
really neat things happening here and honored to be able to do so. So um this is really great. Thank
1:06:01
you for this. I appreciate it. Um have we taken a look at the qual survey from
1:06:07
last year and compared results to this year yet? No, because we didn't do qualics last year. That part of this
1:06:12
reason we wanted we did kind of the old school Google. That's right. That's certainly so I can certainly share
1:06:18
because we we asked very similar questions to me. So we can we can go back and compare. I probably should have just done that but Qualrix kind of
1:06:25
levels everything up from a data collection organization safety and security anonymous. So we
1:06:33
went we went this route. So I didn't even look at the other stuff yet. Okay. So, and then are there remind me on the
1:06:40
Qualrx one is there free form comments too? Yes. Okay. Yep. Um,
1:06:47
for whatever reason we So, what we did was last year we had a lot of we had five or six questions per department.
1:06:54
So, talk about your own building and then you got into communications, you got in teaching, learning, you got in
1:06:59
HR. Well, that made this really long. So, we said let's just make those areas
1:07:05
open-ended. So, here's your box to talk about HR, good, bad, or ugly, right?
1:07:10
Transportation instead of for whatever reason, I didn't failed to put a
1:07:16
open-ended box on me, right? There's not like a superintendent box. You just
1:07:21
there's a last question that was like anything else on your mind essentially. So, there's could be some com but I did
1:07:27
not have like a AJ and Carrie, you guys kind of put this together. I don't I I don't believe
1:07:33
there's this just superintendent go. You ju you just had it in these
1:07:39
questions or at the end you could talk about anything. So probably needs to be added
1:07:47
next year. So thank you. You bet.
1:07:54
You want to you want to spend just a couple minutes? you sent out to the board a couple of uh file, you know,
1:08:00
pretty comprehensive files with a number of artifacts. You just want to kind of spend a couple minutes on that and the
1:08:05
content of that. Yeah. So, board members, as I think, you know, part of my evaluation, you will you'll you'll
1:08:11
kind of get to put your your comments in, but also do a do a form for me as well. Instead of layering the spreadsheet with
1:08:18
a whole bunch of hopefully evidence and documents showing this work, I shared the drives of the documents to go in
1:08:26
there. So what you have access to as of Friday is kind of all the strategic planning documents that we utilized
1:08:34
throughout as well as the presentations mainly from the facility committee with
1:08:39
OPN because my work with them would have been all the stuff behind the scenes and then they go put that in a presentation
1:08:45
and share it out. So um if there is not an item that doesn't have access what I
1:08:52
did was actually made a copy of all of those. So, I hope if you go in the drive, like you know, Juliet Teamworks
1:08:58
owns some of those documents. So, I made a copy so you could have access to it. Um, so if you see one that says copy of,
1:09:05
that's probably your best one to click. Otherwise, if I'm the owner, you have access. So, if you struggle, um, finding
1:09:12
any of those or understanding like don't don't hesitate. But those are the two big Google drives kind of folders I
1:09:19
shared with you all on Friday. one was facilities only and with probably I
1:09:24
think the five presentations and then the strategic plan probably had 15 or 18
1:09:30
documents in there. So that that would be my kind of evidence of this work as well.
1:09:38
Any other questions for Dr. All right, we'll move along.
1:09:51
maybe. Okay, here we go. Um, we'll move along to item nine, old business. Uh,
1:09:58
the second reading of, uh, listed policies. Um, one, three, four, six, 700 series
1:10:06
policies. Looking for a motion.
1:10:12
Move to approve Vanderbilt. Second, Mberg. Any discussion?
1:10:19
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Post same sign. Motion carries. Uh
1:10:25
moving along to item 10, new business. Um Dr. Bloom, I think there's been uh
1:10:31
maybe some new information that came out about a couple of these policies. Yep. So Reagan actually found out today that
1:10:37
we're going to get some updated information from the Department of Ed and ISB in the coming weeks on the cell
1:10:44
phone policy. They're going to have some more in-d depth on the model policies. We just want to make sure we're, you
1:10:50
know, checking all the right boxes for the state on that one. So, what we would like to do is on 50309 the policy um and
1:10:58
50309 R just if we could pause on that so Greg and I can have those meetings with those folks and most likely you
1:11:05
will see then those policies either in the same or any little update at the
1:11:11
June 23rd board meeting. Okay. So I think um we're looking for maybe a bit
1:11:16
of a tailored motion here then that would be specific to 70202 80402 and
1:11:23
5082 looking for a motion
1:11:30
approve second any discussion just a quick question why
1:11:36
are we rescending 5082 um it's probably a touch outdated from
1:11:45
the we are going to have to have like we've
1:11:50
had some practices and events on those Wednesday nights specifically where
1:11:57
some of our coaches we would get in a bind like we have this policy ahead of a state tournament and we can't and it's
1:12:03
it says like up to 7 o'clock so it's like you could do it on a Wednesday but here's this artificial time. So Greg and
1:12:10
I met with Madison and we're like we're a little bit hamstrung with the policy. No one's looking for ways to have all
1:12:16
these practices on Sundays. So we can, you know, have an internal practice trying to stay away from this stuff, but
1:12:25
it honestly just became a little challenging of like we were kind of hamstringing some things at different points of the year that,
1:12:33
you know, we just didn't think it was completely necessary in today's world anyway. So we just
1:12:39
would like the freedom of it without looking for ways to go again practice
1:12:44
till 10 o'clock on a Wednesday or Sunday. So, okay. But certainly feedback
1:12:50
away though. Yeah, I noticed you know especially the
1:12:56
summer I think they play fair bit of baseball on Wednesday nights you get rain delays and you know rain outs and
1:13:02
you know those are the holes in your schedule and you really just don't have a lot of choice and I don't know if this
1:13:07
polic summer or not. But um you know I think
1:13:13
um I I suppose it becomes an issue we could take it back up as business as a board
1:13:21
because we do think it's important to preserve time for families and time for
1:13:26
church and other activities that people do particularly on Wednesday nights and Sundays. So um you know I I think those
1:13:33
are important things. So I think but I also trust you to manage it and your team to manage it. So
1:13:40
yeah, I I would agree. Obviously I don't love this because there's eight billion things already going on. Everybody's I
1:13:45
think this is nice but if there are certain times where this is kind of hurting I guess the coaching the problem would be if then our students you know
1:13:53
that want to do the activities on those nights then you know feel like they can't. So they have to show up so they
1:13:58
start choosing this and this was the safety net for them. So I think I guess the feedback from people once you rescend it you'll know if
1:14:05
it was good or not good. And when we talked with Madison like again we don't I don't see any new change in activity
1:14:13
practice meaning like all of a sudden basketball starts practice at 9:00 like
1:14:18
what we're doing we're going to stay with it. It works. We just started to get in a bind where
1:14:25
like I just we were flat out violating a policy. We thought if we had a
1:14:30
competition on a Wednesday past 7:00 or we needed to do something and it moved
1:14:35
to a you know um football team needed to do X on a on
1:14:42
a Sunday afternoon with athletic name your kind of we just really started like
1:14:48
well it's in policy. This was more about business as usual, but we're we don't
1:14:55
feel like we're violating a policy if there needs to be something on Wednesday. But again, don't don't all of a sudden think every Wednesday
1:15:03
is now a practice at night past 7. It's it just won't happen. So,
1:15:10
good. Any other discussion?
1:15:16
Michelle, did you get what you needed on the motion? All those in favor indicate by saying I. I post same sign. Motion
1:15:24
