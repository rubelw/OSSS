item three. Um and um welcome our
2:16
visitors. Um as usual, I've just got a a quick
2:21
statement that I'll read and then we'll call our guests to the podium. We will
2:26
now open the floor for public comment. I think we have one person on the docket tonight. I'd like to welcome you all to
2:32
the board meeting and thank you for your willingness to speak to us. Per board policy one 213, citizens wishing to
2:38
address the board during public comment must notify the board secretary prior to the board meeting. Public comment is a
2:44
time set aside for community input, but the board will not discuss or take any action on any matter during public
2:50
comment. Please limit your comments to five minutes so we can keep the meeting moving in a timely fashion. When you do
2:56
speak, we ask that you come up to the podium and speak into the microphone so we can hear you. Please begin by stating
3:03
your name and city of residence. We would ask that when speakers are addressing us that everyone will
3:08
maintain professional decorum, listen and refrain from any disruption. Any person who creates a disruption may be
3:15
asked to leave the meeting. I want to also remind all speakers that any comments that may be made during public
3:21
comment are done at the risk of the person making the comment and that the district will not be responsible for any
3:26
defamatory or potentially defamatory statements which may be made when you're called to speak. Thank you for your
3:32
support of our school district. And now we'll have Miss Perez. You may now come to the podium if you'd like.
3:41
The older I get, the bigger the screen. Um, hi, my name is Denise Perez. I am a
3:46
resident of Grimes and a parent of a 2025 graduate. Um, first of all, good
3:51
evening members of the board and administrators. Firstly, I want to thank you for the work that you do for our students, teachers, and community,
3:58
especially during a time where the federal government is holding hostage funding previously approved by Congress.
4:05
I've been actively involved with the district's administration since 2018 as a founding member of DCG Kids Safety.
4:11
And as a parent, I've volunteered, attended meetings, asked hard questions,
4:18
and sorry, I've asked hard questions. I think
4:23
everybody knows that. Um, and tried to support the system because I believe in
4:30
the promise of public education. My child has now graduated and I'll be honest, I'm relieved. I'm relieved
4:37
because that means that they are no longer subject to the increasing dysfunction and inequity and erosion of
4:43
values happening within public education. But I still worry for the children of my friends, my neighbors
4:49
kids, and so many others still here, and they deserve better than what they are currently being given. Despite the
4:57
district's public statements about equity and inclusion, the lived reality for many students tells a different
5:03
story. Students of color are disproportionately disciplined. Girls and LGBTQ students face harassment that
5:11
too often goes unressed. Students from lowincome families encounter invisible
5:17
barriers to participation and access. Immigrant and multilingual students are
5:22
marginalized instead of being embraced as part of a globally minded district. And these failures are happening in the
5:29
context of much larger, much more dangerous, excuse me, much more dangerous political
5:36
climate. Let's be clear that Iowa's public schools are under attack.
5:41
Legislators are deliberately withholding funding from public education while
5:47
funneling taxpayer dollars into private, often religious institutions through school voucher schemes. Christian
5:53
nationalism is influencing education policy, eroding church state separation,
5:59
and marginalizing anyone who doesn't conform to a singular world view. Most
6:05
recently, the board is voting to remove gender identity from the district policy
6:11
along with other protected classes once listed under anti-discrimination and anti-bullying language. We were told
6:19
that the district can still protect all students while stripping those specific
6:24
terms out. But let's be honest, when you stop naming the identities most often
6:29
targeted by discrimination, you stop protecting them. Visibility and possib
6:35
in policy is not symbolic. It is a shield. Removing it sends a chilling
6:40
message to LGBTQ students, students of color, and others. You are no longer
6:46
worth naming. So let me be ab absolutely clear in my call to action. Please
6:51
retain gender identity and other protected classes in our district policies. Do not let political fear or
6:59
legal posturing erase the very students who are most need our support. Following
7:04
the law is not enough. You must lead with moral clarity and the courage to do what's right even when it's hard.
7:12
I also want to point out some concerns that I know I
7:17
have and have been shared by others in the community as perception is reality
7:23
when decisions are made in the dark. In December of 2022,
7:29
Dr. Bloom resigned as high school principal, citing professional challenges and the toll the job was
7:35
taking on his family and mental health. That's a decision that deserves empathy
7:40
and understanding. And yet, four months later, in April of 2023, he was
7:46
appointed interim superintendent, excuse me, following this board's
7:51
abrupt, unexplained, and fiscally irresponsible decision to remove Dr. Grimes at taxpayer expense.
8:00
That kind of inconsistency undermines trust.
8:05
Excuse me. It undermines trust, raises questions about judgment, and ultimately reflects
8:11
a board that is making short-sighted, reactive decisions during a time that demands long-term vision and stability.
8:19
That includes selecting um and let me be clear, sorry. The
8:24
school board is responsible for oversight of the superintendent. That includes selecting, evaluating, and
8:30
holding them accountable, not hiding behind legal counsel or deflecting responsibility when consequences become
8:37
uncomfortable. Meanwhile, our students are paying the price to the board. You were elected to
8:43
represent Oh, I'll finish up an email. Thank you.
8:50
All right, we'll move along um to item six, approved minutes of the previous
8:56
meeting. We've got um the June 23rd regular meeting and the June 24 uh 4th
9:04
board workshop. Looking for a motion. Move to approve. Viola second. Dickinson.
9:09
Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I. I oppose. Same sign.
9:16
Motion carries. Bills looking for a motion. Move to approve. Baker Curtis.
9:23
Second. Vella. Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I.
9:29
I oppose. Same sign. Motion carries the consent agenda. Looking for a motion.
9:35
Move to approve Vandervald and second Dickinson. Any discussion?
9:41
Um just a quick question. I see in here
9:46
um that there is something regarding an audit. Is this in
9:54
this section? I'm sorry. The agreement for Berg and KDV. Yes. And I just had a quick question
9:59
about what that audit was about. That's the single audit as part of our fiscal audit. Single audit looks
10:04
specifically at federal funds because we got safety grant this year. We are going to be over the threshold of 750,000.
10:12
Okay. So, because we got the safety grant, they're looking at our federal
10:17
funding. Anytime you get over 750,000 in federal funds, you're required to do a single audit. And so that's an additional fee
10:24
and an additional Okay, got it. Thank you. Just I had never seen that before.
10:31
So, thank you for your thorough explanation as always. You're welcome. I'm glad.
10:37
Any other discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I. I
10:42
oppose. Same sign. Motion carries. All right. Um Jake
10:48
Anderson and Alex Falls graph are here from the city of Grimes to talk to us a
10:53
little bit about uh what's going on down at the city. So want to welcome you guys and thanks for coming to hang out with
10:59
us for a little bit. Uh yeah, board members, administration, thanks for having us tonight to give you
11:05
a little bit of an update about how what's happening with the city. I'm Jake Anderson. I'm the city manager. I get to
11:11
do for the city council what Dr. Bloom does for for the board here. Um, I don't
11:18
have a lot uh to say. I just kind of wanted to make some opening remarks and then I'll let Alex talk about the
11:23
development activity in town. But uh mostly uh I just wanted to express
11:28
thanks and appreciation for the partnership. Uh I'm regularly in touch with Dr. Bloom and uh the lines of
11:35
communication there are good. Uh so I appreciate uh that effort an awful lot. Uh, and I appreciate that, uh, city
11:43
representatives, myself, Alex, and Eric Johansson, have been included in some of your facility planning. Um, I just know
11:50
from experience that, uh, that those conversations and those coordinating efforts are super important uh between
11:57
this the city and the and the district. So, thank you for those efforts. And I guess with that, I'll turn it over to
12:04
Alex to walk through a presentation and then we'd be happy to take any questions you might have.
12:13
that's not attached. Thank you. Um I appreciate Dr. Bloom inviting us tonight. I know um this is probably long
12:20
overdue. Um but as Jake said, the the the partnership and the relationship with the school district and Dr. Bloom
12:26
um really have improved over the past couple of years. So, we're certainly happy to be here tonight to give you an update and um would very happy to come
12:34
back at any point in time that you have additional questions or would just like more regular updates. But, um just to to
12:41
kick it off a little bit, uh so I uh hold two roles at the city of Grimes, assistant city manager as well as
12:47
development services director. So, I oversee all planning, engineering, and building services for the city. So, um
12:53
quite a wide range there. As you can kind of see, there's a lot going on in Grimes and and really tonight, we're just giving you an update on some of
12:59
those signature developments, key developments that are happening. What I wanted to first start out with was just
13:04
a little overview of some of the annexations that have occurred. Um, this is annexation is the way the city uh
13:11
seeks to incorporate more property from the county into the city. And we've been strategic in certain areas where we know
13:18
that there's growth, where there's been utility provisions made. But um as you can see here on the screen, just uh in
13:23
the past two years, we've annexed well over a thousand acres of new property um all within the Dallas Center Grimes
13:30
School District. Um the land uses within uh these thousand acres generally are
13:36
residential, um some neighborhood, commercial, limited light, industrial, those types of uses.
13:42
Um did want to give you just a little bit of an update on South James Street. Uh because I know that we have an
13:48
increasingly large construction presence in front of South Prairie. Um the the project is expanding the roadway from
13:54
its current two-lane uh kind of ditch section to a three and five lane curb
14:00
and gutter. Um I say three and five lane because there is a divide. So in front of South Prairie it'll be a three-lane
14:06
section which essentially allows for north and south lanes with a center protected turn lane. now. Um, and then
14:11
it's five lane further to the south once you get south of the 11th Street roundabout. This is a part of a multi-phase project improving James
14:18
Street all the way from uh the intersection of East First or Highway 44 all the way to 37th Street. So, it's a
14:24
five and five or six year project, $35 million. We're in phase one of five. So,
14:30
um, more to come on that. And, uh, just kind of building off of the the partnership. I know that Dr. Bloom just
14:36
got back from a meeting with our staff uh, just a little bit ago. So, we're uh in constant communication with Dr. Bloom
14:43
and and the other kind of logistic team members within the school district trying to prepare for when school opens
14:48
back up in in the fall. Um Highway 44 is just another one I
14:53
wanted to touch base on um because obviously it'll have an impact to the the high school. Um, we are currently
14:59
working on conceptual designs for Highway 44 with our traffic consultant, Snyder and Associates. Um, and working
15:06
with uh the school district staff as well as your consultant team, OPN, on kind of the master planning efforts of
15:12
the high school and how um future roadway improvements to Highway 44 um will interact and improve access and um
15:19
kind of the the campus feeling here. Uh it is a project that is still a few years out. We're working on kind of said
15:26
that conceptual design. We've got some agreements that have to get put in place with the DOT, seek some funding, and
15:31
then um we anticipate it's a 7 to 10 year construction project as you move through the whole corridor. So, not
15:37
necessarily that length in front of the high school, but over that entire uh three or four mile corridor.
15:50
Oh. Um, so this is a a slide that I like to show that just really talks about the
15:56
proposed residential growth that the city has experienced or um has done entitlements or approvals on over the
16:02
past five years. Um, since 2020, um, over 5,100 residential units have been
16:08
proposed uh within the city of Grimes. Um, now, as you know, we do straddle two school districts. Um but 90% of those
16:15
units um have been um authorized within the Dallas Center Grimes School District boundary. So only about 500 are within
16:22
the the Johnston School District to the very north and um on the east side of Highway 141. Um and then um you can kind
16:29
of see the the legend there just shows how many units have been reszoned, how many units have been planned, approved,
16:35
um how many have been platted, and then how many are under construction. So, um, of that 5,100, about 1,800 are under
16:42
construction in some way, and that's, um, multif family, town home, single family, kind of the broad spectrum of
16:49
residential housing units. Um, this is just going to move into the
16:55
next five or six slides, just focusing on some kind of key developments. Uh this is a a development within the Hope
17:00
District which would be on the very north end of the H High Multiplex uh
17:06
sports athletic complex adjacent to Beaverbrook Boulevard. There are 80 town homes and 320 apartment units. These
17:14
would be um kind of considered a more luxury unit. They are gated. They have amenities, underground parking. Um if
17:20
you've been in that area, you'll see a majority of the town home units are under construction. Apartments are anticipated to start here pretty soon.
17:26
Uh we anticipate this project will wrap up within the next 12 months. Harvest Point, uh this is 19th and South
17:34
James, so this would be directly south of the South Sports Complex or the South Prairie Elementary complex. Um this
17:41
project and the very next one that I'll talk about, uh we're part of a recent land transaction from um a a family that
17:48
had about 500 acres within the city of Grimes along 19th Street. Um we've kind of uh referred to them as kind of a
17:54
sleeping giant in the past. have a large land holding but not a lot of communication with the city. And then um
18:00
through the city's kind of strategic investment and infrastructure, sanwer, water, roadway improvements, we saw the
18:07
property owner kind of start to move their their pieces. So um Harvest Point, which is owned by um Temple, and then um
18:14
the next one, Hubble Development, have acquired about 280 acres within the city and um have already started construction
18:21
on their development. So, the Harvest Point, which is owned by Temple, has 870 units. Um, their first phase, which is
18:27
56 single family lots, is under construction right now. And then there's a variety of other land uses um within
18:34
their overall development, which is about 120 acres. Founders Glenn, which was the development I was just referring
18:39
to previously, is a Hubble development. Um, they have about 160 acres at Southwest 19th and Southwest County Line
18:46
Road. Uh, 711 total units, uh, 69 single family lots in that first phase. Um I do
18:52
expect that both of these developments will move pretty quickly. They've ant they've indicated to the city that they
18:57
hope to be um completed with their single family development within three to four years. Um so between the two um
19:04
I think there's close to 450 new single family units that will come online in the in the coming years.
19:13
Meadows, which you should all be familiar with, just south of here, the
19:18
south of the district office and north of the Oak View campus along 11th and uh
19:24
Southwest County Line Road and then going all the way up to Highway 44, um is a primarily residential development
19:29
that's been under construction for the past couple of years. Um that phase one um of the total 794 units. Um there's 69
19:37
single family lots. You see homes being built right now. We're actively receiving more permits. Phase two, um,
19:42
which is kind of hard to see unless you go over there, is the balance of the single family. So that's another 195
19:48
single family lots that will be online, um, within probably the next 60 days. So we'd anticipate that there's fall
19:54
construction happening uh, within that second phase um, just shortly.
19:59
Hope Horizon um, is a 240 acre development just north of the the Dallas
20:04
Undergrounds High School campus um, at the intersection of Northwest Beaver Boulevard and Northwest Countyline Road.
20:10
Um again, this is north of the high school campus. Uh 1,24 units in total,
20:15
principally single family. Um there are some some areas and opportunities for some medium density and some higher
20:21
density. Large focus on parks and greenways in this area. We have um which is kind of uh on the south center
20:28
portion of the development. You can kind of see a large um park that's about 20 acres in size. We strategically put that
20:36
against the high school campus with the hope um that in the future with additional campus planning efforts that
20:42
there could be a um a really really great project someday that blends the
20:48
high school campus with um a large municipal park and talking about sharing
20:53
resources and really u amenities and trying to capitalize on each other's investments. Um this is a project that
20:59
we've worked with Dr. Bloom and his team on quite a bit. um how those project how those two uh properties could come
21:06
together, roadway improvements, all of that um all those different components.
21:13
And then uh the Southwest 19th Street development, which is um again along Southwest 19th and Southwest Jazzwood.
21:20
Um this is an area uh that you saw earlier on the slide where we've recently annexed um about 350 acres,
21:28
primarily all single family. Um there's a few medium density areas but principally single family 720 total
21:34
units. We are working with property owners right now on the reszones. Um so we expect those to become public here
21:39
pretty soon. And then um all parties which there are about four land owners within this 350 acres have expressed
21:47
interest in moving forward pretty quickly on their own developments. Uh so we'd expect that we see permit activity
21:53
here um probably within the next uh 18 to 24 months is what I'd anticipate. Uh
21:58
this is also an area um as you can as you know along Southwest 19th Street once you get past County Line Road it
22:05
turns back into a gravel section and then is granular all the way up to the bus barn. Uh the city of Grimes and City
22:11
of Urbandale are partnering on the asphalt overlay of both of those stretches as well as the stretch from
22:19
the intersection of 19th and county line south to um would be Waterford. So that
22:26
stretch. Um I know that we've um at least I know the city of Grimes has heard um complaints from uh
22:36
parents of uh uh the district students that likely open and roll from Urbandale
22:42
into Grimes and are utilizing that path coming uh coming north. So um we've been
22:47
working with Urbanddale for a couple years now on an agreement of sorts of how to get all of those roadways paved.
22:53
So, I think that will um do a couple of things for us. It certainly gives us more ways in and out of the community,
22:58
which is always good. Um but also um kind of better, safer ways in and out of
23:03
the schools in the immediate area. So, we're excited about that. Uh in addition, there's a water mane
23:08
improvements that are going on um in this area with the asphalt paving to help support that development. And then
23:14
this is generally the path where our uh sewer happened as well. Also, we have
23:19
sewer, water, roads, all of the pieces of the pie to make a development happen.
23:25
And then I'm just leaving you here. Um, you know, planning is something that I take near and dear to heart. I'm a city
23:31
planner by trade. Um, and uh was trained uh by the great Dr. Balloon back in high
23:37
school in my government class. So, kind of come full circle. So, any issues with me, you can uh blame
23:44
on him, but I'm just kidding. Um, but uh, planning is something that we continue to do. Uh, right now the city
23:50
of Grimes is working on a comprehensive plan. Uh, so the last time we did a full comp plan was in 2010. We did a what I
23:57
call kind of a soft update in 2018 2019, which really just updated demographics, took a look at some of those vision
24:03
statements, reaffirmed whether or not they're um, still good or bad. And then um, as you know, since 2018 2019, the
24:11
city's really kind of boomed. Um we've seen uh close to a billion dollars in uh new development activity uh just in that
24:17
fiveyear time frame, which is a staggering amount. Um probably about half of the city's valuation can be attributed in that last five or six
24:24
years. Um so when you start getting into that uh tier of development and you
24:29
start checking all the boxes in your old comp plan, it says go do a new comp plan. So we've worked with Confluence on
24:34
um that planning effort. We anticipate adopting it prior to the end of the calendar year. Um, we've also started
24:39
working on a retail market study. We know that there's a correlation between housing and retail. They both need each
24:46
other. Uh, folks that come to your community want retail. Retail wants rooftops. So, we've tried to take a
24:53
strategic look at that retail u market within the city. What opportunities exist? It'll help inform land use and
24:59
our comprehensive planning uh and really be a economic development tool for our staff to help uh go out and get the best
25:07
retail development that we can and then that corresponds into the best residential development that we can get.
25:13
That is what I have for you tonight. Um but I appreciate your time. Certainly happy to answer any questions. Um and
25:18
Jay can answer any that you have as well. Does board have questions?
25:23
Thank you. That was interesting. Absolutely. Yeah, like I said, we're we're happy to come anytime uh give you
25:30
an update. Um I know we've really appreciated Dr. Bloom and he's come to some of our city council meetings and
25:35
provided some some school district perspective on some developments. So, we've appreciated that and um extend the
25:41
offer to come back anytime that you guys want us to. Appreciate that. Alex, maybe just one question. It's really around um
25:48
permits. You know, we been tracking, you know, we we always track permits and we track permit activity. So, we've got a
25:54
pretty good trended number on that for probably a decade or longer. And probably up until 2021, we were seeing a
26:02
number, you know, a lot larger than than what we've seen after 2021. Can you just
26:07
give us a little bit of intel around what's driving that? Was it just there was plenty of capacity to build and
26:14
things slowed down or was it really just a a capacity issue? Yeah, we didn't have a lot of lots for sale
26:20
and that was Yeah. why we saw it slow down? Absolutely. That's a great question. Um, there's a lot of factors that play into
26:26
it. The, uh, in my opinion, number one driving factor is lot inventory. So,
26:32
what is available for the city to build. If you look historically, um, from that 2016 to 2021 time frame, um, the city
26:40
was on average issuing anywhere from 180 to 220 single family dwelling units. At
26:46
that same time, the city was maintaining um what I would average to be like a two to two and a half uh consumption to
26:54
inventory balance. So meaning uh if we consume 200 homes, we need to have 500 in inventory in order to kind of keep
27:01
that churn and keep that demand going. What had happened prior to that was you saw an influx of of lots occur. So you
27:08
saw Autumn Park come online, you saw the balance of heritage come online. Um there was just a lot of development
27:14
occurring um in terms of like single family lots and our inventory was hovering in that like six to 700 range,
27:21
you know, and we'd consume 200 and then put 50 or 60 in and then we consume 200
27:26
and then we might not put any in. Um so over time as you take three or four
27:31
years of 200 homes being built and you're only sitting on 700 in inventory, we've just been playing catch-up. So we
27:38
put lots on the market and then they get consumed. put lots on the market and we get consumed. So that has been hurting
27:45
us in the past couple of years. I think that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. As you can see, there's significant single family inventory
27:52
coming back online which we just haven't experienced in um you know the past three or four years. Um you might see a
27:59
a 40 acre track of ground go and you get you know two phases of 40 lots get put
28:04
in and we turn through those pretty quickly. Um so seeing largecale
28:10
development return to Grimes I think is a good sign. Um and we're hearing a lot
28:15
of interest um anytime we talk to a builder they say when are lots back or when are you going to have these
28:21
available because there is that kind of pent up demand in our opinion it's just um we need that inventory. I think
28:28
there's also some other contributing factors that occurred 2020 and on. Um COVID had a big impact on um a
28:34
residential development uh really to a positive. You saw a lot happened because interest rates came down. But then as
28:40
interest rates came back up, you saw kind of the typical development cycle flip, which means uh you uh developers
28:46
and uh contractors shift to um you know types of uh development that don't
28:52
require acquisition. So they may seek like rentals like town homes or apartments. So you just kind of see that kind of eb and flow. Um so we cons saw a
29:01
lot of uh construction in that multif family and town home market. Um a lot of our current numbers are coming from
29:07
that. Uh you'll start to see that slow down. That's based on really inventory again. There isn't a lot of available
29:13
lots for that type of development. And then the single families coming back. So um yeah, there's just a lot of
29:18
contributing factors, but I would say primarily it's related to the housing inventory um which we feel much more
29:24
confident in. Now, yeah, if I can build on that a little bit, I would I would say I mean, don't discount some of the macroeconomic
29:30
factors though either. Interest rates are certainly going to have a an impact on people's ability for mortgage
29:37
payments. Um, but then I think there are some community politics at play as well.
29:44
Uh, we have seen uh housing subdivision plans presented. uh the neighbors get
29:51
upset about that because you know their realtor might have told them that uh that would always be a cornfield behind
29:57
your house. Um and then when uh the neighborhood shows up angry uh we listen
30:03
to them. Uh one thing that Dr. wounded. That was extraordinarily helpful to us was to come to a council meeting and
30:10
talk about the importance of continuing to issue permits and put uh put homes
30:15
and basements in the ground and build. Uh absent that perspective, what what we
30:21
hear as an organization from the public is that we don't want more growth. uh
30:27
you know we so that's not the position of the city but we hear that from the residents and it
30:33
makes it really difficult for our volunteer PNZ uh commission members and
30:39
our volunteer elected officials to you know to to make some sort of a decision
30:44
uh that runs counter to that. So so civic engagement is important. Dr. Bloom's participation in the council
30:51
meeting uh continues to pay dividends and as we remind people of those comments uh in successive meetings. So,
30:58
uh to Alex's point, a multitude of variables there, but uh don't discount
31:04
macroeconomic things and and the political process. Yeah, appreciate that. That's good
31:09
perspective. Maybe a bit of a selfish question. You know, I suppose these developments that you just showed us and
31:15
thanks for that. It's really helpful for us to understand what's coming. um you know uh probably um homes like
31:25
first-time home buyer, second home, that's probably in our mind the kind of um development that really helps grow,
31:33
you know, the school district. And so kind of selfishly, that's maybe the segment of what we're looking at that I
31:39
think we're interested in. And not to say that those other um properties don't
31:44
have school age kids in them. I would just say probably to a lesser degree. Can can you kind of just give us a
31:50
perspective on a year just maybe a year from now or 18 months from now? How much of that kind of single family home
31:56
product is going to be or or lots that would kind of support that kind of home? Um new, you know, first-time home buyer
32:05
or something that a young family may be interested in purchasing. Yeah. Compared to where we're at today.
32:10
Absolutely. Yeah. I think you have a number of really good developments coming online that will meet those needs
32:16
that you identified. Um the development uh directly to the east of us at Hope
32:22
Timber. Um that was a development that Dr. Bloom came and and spoke about to our city council. Um but it has a kind
32:31
of a unique concept where they are kind of town home style units but detached. So they have that single family look and
32:38
feel. you don't share walls with anybody, but um you might have like an HOA package of sorts. Um those are all
32:45
likely to enter the market in the like 275 to 400 range. So I think that's kind
32:52
of meeting your uh kind of crazy to think that that's your entry level and
32:57
and first home first-time home buyer, but that's really what it is. Um, in a more traditional single family, both the
33:03
the Harvest Point and the Founders Glenn along 19th Street, those initial phases are in, you know, we start to look at uh
33:10
lot size. So, in that 60 to 65 foot lot range, um, which is still going to be a
33:16
70, $80,000 lot, five times home value, you're in that 350 to 400 pretty easily.
33:22
Um, if people aren't finishing basements, that type of thing. That's usually how folks can get into the market. Um those are all going to come
33:29
online in the next year. Um I would say the same thing in your Hope Meadows development. Um there's a a pocket of 60
33:35
to 65 foot lots about a hundred of them that will um certainly start to meet those um those needs as well. So um and
33:43
that's not to say that those developments don't have larger lots as well. So you really have kind of a broad spectrum of of single family inventory
33:50
coming online. But what I would expect to occur in the next 12 to 18 months is going to be in that kind of first-time
33:56
home buyer, maybe your second home moving up type of environment.
34:01
Board have other questions. Would there be any lower income housing developments more affordable
34:07
coming? Um below 350,000 for a firsttime homeowner.
34:13
So, housing affordability isn't something that the city uh can directly influence
34:20
um primarily because of the the Fair Housing Act um that really everyone's kind of
34:25
subject to dealing with. Um I would say in um our a lot of our developments
34:31
there are um variety of land uses. So, we have town homes, we have apartments. um you
34:38
know whether or not they are provided a market rate or an affordable rate again isn't something that the city necessarily gets involved with. I do
34:45
know that on the other side of 141 uh across Beaverbrook and a north of Menards there are some kind of what's
34:52
called workforce housing um which is housing that's maybe not uh uh maybe not
34:59
affordable in terms of uh received like tax credits or any sort of like special financing but they're constructed in a
35:05
manner or maybe financed privately in a manner that allows them to meet certain
35:10
income thresholds. So, those have generally been in that 80% AMI um which
35:15
uh is a pretty kind of average affordability rate for for folks when they're doing development to try to get
35:20
to. Um so, those have occurred. And then, um
35:26
but you know, in the traditional single family, uh housing affordability is just a it's a tough it's a it's a tough
35:32
conversation and topic just because there's so many variables that go into when you're building a single family
35:38
home. you have, you know, the lot and the infrastructure and then just the typical construction. So, um, for it to
35:44
meet a an affordability metric, uh, defined by the state in a single family setting is just really challenging.
35:50
Are there Thank you very much. That was very well handled. Thank you. um
35:56
with the city of Grimes, are there policies in place that um
36:02
work with like tiny homes or in Dallas Center, we're
36:08
having conversations a lot about um like mother-in-law suites. There is a word for this that our city manager
36:14
dwelling. Yep. Yep. Um is that a thing that Grimes is entertaining or doing or are there
36:20
policies on the books? Yeah. So, I would say um after this uh most recent
36:26
legislative session, we don't have a choice. Uh so, the state mandated ADUs or accessory dwelling units or
36:32
additional dwelling unit, kind of what you want to call it, uh for all single family residences across the state of
36:37
Iowa. So, um, we are kind of in the process of working through what does the
36:42
legislation mean, um, and what kind of rules can be put in place for, uh, the
36:48
construction of those accessory dwelling units. Um, we just attended some trainings on it just last week. So, uh,
36:55
what we'll be working on through our comprehensive planning effort is how we can develop appropriate regulations, uh,
37:01
true to the intent of that code, um, that was put in place to allow for those
37:07
types of units to be constructed in the city. Wonderful. And one final question because I am very partial to parks. Um
37:14
and again in Dallas Center where we are talking about um developments there is a mandatory um aotment of um certain
37:23
number of square footage of park y or green space per acre of development. Is
37:29
that something that Grimes also has in place? Yes. Yep. So we have a we call it a parkland dedication ordinance. It's
37:35
based on the population generated by the development. Okay. So um different units uh generally
37:42
based on our census standards dictate certain population per unit. So just going to give you an example. Typically
37:48
single family home is going to have more people in it than an apartment will. Um so if you take that uh factor uh
37:54
population factor against the number of units, it's going to generate an acreage that's required. Um
38:00
so in the city of Grimes, we require six and a half acres of parkland for every thousand people generated. So if you
38:05
have 2,000 people within the development, that could be you have 13 acres of park.
38:11
Fantastic. Yep. So we can be looking forward to more parks. Yeah. Yeah. And then and then we've been
38:16
really kind of strategic on like where we locate those parks. Again, kind of pointing back to that that hope horizon
38:21
development um just with the balance of the school district property on the north end. You know, again, full disclosure, not knowing what you folks
38:28
are going to do with it, but um being able to put 20 25 acres of property directly adjacent to that. Um the model
38:35
um was the uh Walke Northwest campus where they have Triumph Park and then the kind of northern end of the
38:42
Northwest campus really has a a really kind of great public amenity there. And I know both the city and school district
38:48
were able to share on a lot of those infrastructure costs um to help kind of bring down the cost of both of those
38:55
developments uh for the taxpayer which kind of we both represent on different sides. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you.
39:00
Yeah, no problem. Could you pull up the high school? Could you go back to the high school?
39:06
Um picture. This one? Yep. Yeah. So, we're talking that green here
39:11
at the bottom. That's what's going to be north of the high school campus. Correct. Okay. So, then that road that's kind of to the
39:18
west. Is that the one we're talking about at some point would connect to an ex? Okay.
39:24
Yep. To another exit.
39:29
What's the brown? What's the sub by the way? Absolutely. Y So the darkest brown um would be medium density town home.
39:37
Okay. Uh the lighter brown, so it would be kind of the one on this side is multif
39:45
family and then uh the variety of other colors with like the smaller lots is just different lot sizes of single family. So
39:52
that um uh kind of gets to Mr. Carpenters's point about those variety
39:58
of entry points for housing. So like purple in this case is like 50 foot wide lots. Um yellow is um I believe 55,
40:06
green is 60 and then the orange is like your 70 foot traditional.
40:14
Thank you.
40:19
Any other I know from reading the newsletter um and from participating in your survey
40:28
um and just the general information you all put out that there is going to be a special census conducted in order to
40:35
learn more about our specific population, the needs, future planning.
40:41
Um, I believe also what was stated in that
40:47
update was something about the ability for the city to apply for grant funding
40:52
and such. As we look to the future um and we talk
40:59
about green spaces and parks um the city has been very responsive um
41:07
and always taking feedback from the community and designing spaces that work for all of the people in our community.
41:14
Uh what sort of discussion is there about um placing of perhaps
41:22
some sort of an inclusive park in one of these developments? Yeah, I don't know if we've had um a
41:28
detailed or pointed conversation about that. I know that uh we check some of
41:34
those boxes just through our standard park development or even facility development whether or not that's
41:40
putting adultsiz changing tables in our public restrooms which we've had at the splash pad, the hy multiplex, um the
41:47
library. Um but also just in like things like the surfacing of our playgrounds. So, um,
41:52
we're utilizing either a synthetic turf or a port in place surfacing that does allow for, um, those that are wheelchair
41:59
bound to, uh, kind of still enjoy the same amenities. Um, but, uh, in addition
42:05
to that, obviously, we're meeting all the typical like ADA standards. So, that's, uh, you know, water bottle
42:10
filling or, uh, drinking found heights, uh, parking, that type of thing. So, so
42:16
we we try to deploy all of those in our parks and facilities where we can. Um
42:21
but to the question about is there a specific inclusive identify park that hasn't happened yet just because it
42:28
hasn't happened yet. Not that um we're not interested in that. It's just uh we've been
42:33
it was one of the survey questions. Absolutely. Yep. For sure.
42:38
Okay. Yeah. No problem. Any other questions?
42:45
Jake, Alex, appreciate you coming. So informative. let us and always let the board know how
42:51
we can uh support you all. You guys have done a great job supporting us. We appreciate your partnership very much.
42:58
Absolutely. Jake, this is probably more for you real quick. His presentation skills dramatically improved
43:04
since his senior year. I mean, the guy was just a shaken mess.
43:09
He doesn't even remember that. We'll make a note. Yeah, that was I was super proud of that
43:16
young whippers snapper up there. Thanks, Jill. Thanks, guys.
43:21
Great. Um, OPN, um, so OPN's been working for the last several months to
43:27
develop, uh, a 10-year, uh, master plan and, um, so we'll, uh, hear from them
43:33
just kind of about uh, those those improvements. Great.
43:40
There we go. Okay, maybe some introductions first. I'm Kristen Lewis. I'm a managing principal in our De
43:46
Moines studio. I'm Ken Hagen. I am uh the regional uh K12 director for um the de studio as
43:55
well. And then with us today we've got Chad from um DCI Group as well who's the been
44:00
the construction manager. They're helping with construction um costing and phasing and all those fun things. So
44:06
they've been a part of this project as well. So a couple people that aren't with us tonight though, Roger Leer from Modus.
44:13
So if there's any specific mechanical questions, we might take notes and ask him and then um James Roire from Bishop
44:20
Engineering has been helping us as well for site development. Great.
44:26
Awesome. So we wanted to just give you an overview of where we're at. We've spent I think the last seven months or
44:32
so um working through a facility master plan. We'll talk about what that process
44:37
looked like. um we'll talk about kind of what we did for condition assessments and educational assessments. We'll look
44:44
at um a big list of needs that we found for your buildings and then we'll kind of talk about how all those things start
44:50
to come together into concepts and timeline and those kinds of things. So
44:56
um so what is a facility master plan? Um so a facility master plan is really we think of it as a road map. Um, it really
45:03
helps give you some ideas on how and when you might be spending dollars on
45:09
improvements to your facilities. These improvements could be small things like roof replacements um, which are a part
45:15
of the master plan. They can also be bigger things like um, new buildings or new construction. So, it just helps kind
45:21
of identify all the things that are needed. Um, in this case, it's looking forward about seven years. Um, we'll
45:26
talk about that here in a little bit, but um, it it should help give you some ideas on what to plan for in the future.
45:35
So, our planning process um, includes a lot of steps. We've met with a ton of people. Um, Ken spent a lot of time in
45:42
all of your facilities. Um, we did the cons conditions assessments, which is
45:48
really walking around everything, taking a look, poking at things, trying to see what's what condition everything is in.
45:54
Um, we met with all of the educators, um, and did educational assessments with your building, um, staff, like
45:59
principles. Um, and then we met with a facility advisory committee, which was, um, a group of community and parents and
46:05
some of you here in this room. Um, and got to have a chance to talk about priorities and where the needs are and
46:12
confirm direction. Um, and now we're kind of here today to show you what that all looks like and and what the concepts
46:19
are. Um, moving forward from today, you'll have to decide um in the future
46:24
um if you want to choose to do a bond referendum, how we're going to support the funding of these projects. Um, but
46:30
tonight, we just want to give you a good overview of where we're at today. Oh, our slides keep kind of sliding
46:36
around here. We have odd size of slide. Apparently, we must. Yeah. I spent so much time in your
46:42
facilities Oh, sorry. That Dr. Bloom and your facilities department stopped letting me in and just giving me a key
46:48
card, access card so I can just crawl around wherever I need to. Um it was uh really great to see kind of everything
46:54
that you guys have put in place. Um we started with a lot of visual inspection going around looking at things,
47:00
understanding what's happening at all your facilities. Um talking with your facilities department, talking with your
47:06
administrators and your staff. Um really wanted to review those things at a high level as well as looking at existing
47:13
building drawings. So once we went out and looked at things visually, we went back and understood things uh on a
47:19
drawing level to understand maybe some of the nuts and bolts of what were happening within each building. Um the
47:25
high school was something that we really took a lot of time on. We reviewed every single room in the high school. We
47:30
looked at everything. We we really poked around that building uh from start to finish. Um the other schools were more
47:37
of a we would look at a a type of classroom, right? or high different impact spaces like the gymnasium or the
47:43
cafeteria or the kitchen uh to get a really good understanding of what's happening in each one of those schools. And that's really because we understood
47:50
the high school to be the biggest need uh right out of the gate. Uh but we wanted to verify that and really uh run
47:56
that to ground. I have the the clicker, don't I? You do. You've given it to me.
48:02
All right. Um, so this is just kind of a a big long list of like all the stuff that we found
48:07
at the the different facilities of just the the physical um pieces of of of
48:15
infrastructure and of the building. Um, what the big takeaway here is your your
48:21
facilities are really in good shape, especially your elementary schools. Um,
48:26
very well taken care of. There's just some things that are coming to the end of the useful life in each one of these facilities. uh with the exception of the
48:33
high school, there's some, and we'll get into this a little bit, there's some um things that we found on the exterior
48:38
wall systems that were not quite up to speed that we would like to really remedy those as we move forward with
48:44
projects. Um the next thing we did was look at an
48:49
educational assessment process. Um this is where we would talk your uh staff and
48:55
administration to each one of the buildings to understand how the buildings were being used. Um, we toured each one, uh, looked at all the rooms,
49:02
understood what was happening, um, how how special education was being taught, um, where the buses came in, how many
49:08
classrooms do you have, where's your prek, like all of those kinds of questions we would run through. Um, are
49:14
there is there anything that's lacking in any of these that you would really want to see happen? Um, those are the
49:19
kinds of things that we really dug into and understood how teaching was happening in each one of these buildings as well. Um so that's that's something
49:28
that we really dug into a lot. Um so again creating a list of
49:34
understanding what all those needs were. Um we also looked at capacity of each one of the each one of the buildings. Um
49:41
the one that really stuck out obviously and you can see here is the high school. Um doing a capacity analysis of that
49:47
you're sitting around just under a thousand kids right now. You house about,73 kids. So, and that was really
49:54
reflected in when we talked to the the administration there understanding that they they were packing 30 to 32 kids in
50:02
classrooms. They were doing that kind of stuff. There were no empty classrooms. Um teachers oftentimes had to share or
50:08
will be sharing I think next year classrooms. So, those are all the things that we started to sus out and
50:14
understand uh those those needs. Um elementary schools, middle schools all
50:19
have pretty good capacity. you know, you'll see that as you go through. Um there's even some empty classrooms in
50:25
some of the elementary schools. So, I think that there's plenty of uh room for growth in those, but the high school
50:30
ended up being your biggest need, which was um kind of echoed in what we heard up front.
50:37
So, just looking at uh a big picture of we did we can show you the calculus on
50:43
this. Uh we went through a number of different ways to to calculate these numbers, but essentially what um what we
50:50
were asked to do is look to see what it would take to have the high school capacity reach 1500 students. Um hearing
50:57
what the the city had to say about, you know, new rooftops, things of that nature coming
51:03
in, I think that this is a a very fair uh number to try to hit. So what that
51:09
looks like is as we look at additional spaces um eight additional spaces in the classrooms uh and four additional CTE
51:17
spaces. What we found as we walk through um career and technical education is really um is a big need at the high
51:24
school. Um the classrooms where you have a number of classrooms oftentimes are a
51:30
little bit smaller than what we would like to see in a in a standard high school classroom and you have a lot of redundancy and that is just based on you
51:38
bringing together the high school and the and the middle school. So you have two kitchens and two cafeterias and you
51:43
know you used to have two libraries, one of those is kind of switched over to something else now. But um all those things are just kind of adding to um the
51:51
need to reorganize the building a little bit and understand how we might be able to make better use of some of those spaces um and really try to find better
52:00
utilization for your high school uh classrooms which will help drive up those numbers which is why you don't see a bigger number in the classroom need uh
52:07
because we're planning on having a higher utilization. We can talk about that as we get into the high school project in and of itself.
52:15
Um, I think that's it. All right. So, um, thanks, Ken. That
52:24
that generated a whole long list of projects. And this is a summary of all of them. We won't go through line item
52:30
by line item here, but once we complete the master plan, you guys can get copies of that so you can kind of see and
52:36
really dive into more detail. Um, generally you can see as you visually look at this, the high school has kind
52:42
of the most the most needs in terms of um, as Ken said, um, reorganizing the
52:48
building so that it's not two buildings anymore. It's really functioning as one. Um, and then there are a number of
52:55
projects um, for the middle school and the elementary schools. Um, and this was
53:01
really interesting to unpack with the facility advisory committee. um we reviewed all of these needs with them
53:07
and then began to kind of think about prioritizing. So um as we met with the
53:13
facility advisory committee, we presented all this information and it's a lot to digest. So we asked um the
53:20
group to um think about what was most important and really um you know using a
53:25
variety of survey tools. um safety and security rose to the top. Of course, you know, that's the number one priority for
53:32
our facilities is that they're safe and secure. And we know um based off of some of the the projects listed there that we
53:38
do have some needs in your um high school doesn't have a secure entry. Um your middle school um needs, so secure
53:46
entry and a couple of elementary school projects need secure entry. So those were things that rose to the top as
53:51
needing to be addressed sooner than later. Um, and then of course the the high school campus itself and the last
53:58
three bullet points here, high school campus, capacity and classroom space was really about the high school. Um, we
54:05
went on a tour of the high school with the facility advisory committee. Um, so everybody could kind of see if they've
54:10
never had a kid there or whatever, they could see what state the building is in. Um, and we could all kind of feel that
54:17
it's tight. Um, the CTE area is really just a combined woods and metals lab.
54:23
And if you go to some other districts around um the area, you'll find um those are separated spaces. Um they have more
54:30
project area. They're incorporating other kinds of maker spaces and other opportunities for education for
54:36
students. Um so that really kind of came into focus as an area of need um here in
54:42
the future as we look at the high school. So again, this is a list. So we take
54:50
that list with the facility advisory committee and we begin to prioritize it. And so in our phase one grouping of
54:56
projects, we see a reimagination of the high school kind of come to the front as
55:01
well as middle school uh renovations and then um Dallas Center Elementary secure
55:07
ent secure entry as well as Northridge secure entry and then a little bit of work at Oak View with some athletics
55:13
pieces to improve um those areas as well. And then phase two is um looking
55:20
at South Prairie for mechanical and really kind of working on some of the mechanical replacements that need to happen in the next few years. Um
55:27
Heritage as well and then looking at the district operations center. There's some needs there um for for that area moving
55:35
forward. Um and then Northridge Elementary kind of comes in a little bit later and Ken will walk us through some of these in a little more detail, but um
55:42
and then finally phase four is uh some work at the high school. Um, as you grow your enrollment, you will need to have a
55:49
larger stadium for spectators. Um, so down the road, you'll want to think
55:55
about how do we increase our capacity at the stadium with some new bleachers, press box, um, you know, just parking
56:02
probably out there, too. So, we'll talk about that here in a minute.
56:07
Um so if we take all those bundles and begin to kind of put them all together, you can start to see how this maps out
56:13
um on in a timeline. Um the blue projects are those first phase which is
56:19
the high school, Oak View, Middle School, Dallas, Dallas Center Elementary, and Northridge. Um that all
56:26
is uh really you're really looking at probably a three to four year window to complete all of that work. Um then as
56:33
funding is available you can begin to work on the next phase of projects and it kind of all kind of staggers down
56:39
from there. Um and we think it's achievable to complete all this work in the next seven seven to 10 years.
56:49
Looking at this kind of in just a more graphic way. Um again you've got the
56:54
seven-year kind of time horizon for your master plan. There were a couple of projects, larger projects that came up
57:00
during our facility advisory committee meetings um and we have kind of plugged them into the future because they they
57:07
came up but they didn't arise um to the level of priority as these that are listed here. Those included a new
57:15
auditorium um your auditorium seats 5 600 or so
57:20
um which is a little small for a large high school uh facility. Many are around that thousand seat um number. So that
57:27
might be something you consider in the future as you're growing the the size of your enrollment. Um we also know that
57:34
you know somewhere down the road there might be a new elementary school and possibly an early childhood center as
57:39
well as ways to kind of incorporate or grow your enrollment. So these were
57:44
things that kind of they came up. They're important, you know, to keep on your radar in the future, but they're
57:49
out um outside of the kind of window that we were looking at.
57:56
So, the projects themselves, um, I'm sorry, I'm used to projecting, so
58:02
standing next to a microphone is is odd for me. Um,
58:07
so at Dallas Center Elementary, um, this was one of those the early I identified
58:13
as needing a secure entry. Um, really it's a matter of reorganizing the building a little bit. Um, we're going
58:19
to bring the guidance that sits at the north or the the entry, moving it to the back and moving what is the current
58:25
administration area to the front. Um, punching a hole through that existing um, wall and creating a secure
58:31
vestibule. Does everybody know what a secure vestibule is? Is everybody familiar? Okay, great. I won't dive into
58:37
the detail on that too much. Then, um, there's some other things that are going to go along with that. Um, we've got some fire panel upgrades and um, we are
58:44
including an inclusive playground in every elementary school that we touch. So each one of those has that included
58:49
in in the cost of of what we're doing at Northridge.
58:55
Um again, the secured entry um we have to touch a little bit less of this building in order to make that secure
59:01
entry kind of a reality. It's basically cutting a hole in your pre-cast wall. We'll have to figure out where exactly
59:06
that happens. Um they're a little pnicity about just cutting holes in in giant concrete walls, but we'll we'll
59:13
get through that. Um there's some other things that that are going to go along with that at first um with the North
59:19
Ridge project with some tuck pointing and some re-roof window replacement stuff like that. Um again inclusive
59:25
playground and then we have some larger mechanical system upgrades that we'll do there. There's some heat pumps that that
59:30
are going to be replaced. Um some building automation systems, things of that nature. That's just the extent of
59:37
my mechanical knowledge. So if you ask me any other questions about mechanical, I'll just have to defer. Um
59:45
so at the middle school we start to get into some heavier kind of reorganization of the building. As we worked with uh
59:51
the staff there what we realized is um as as we talked to them they like to
59:56
teach in teams. So even number of classrooms is something that is really important there. Um for whatever reason
1:00:03
two of your neighborhoods or two of your pods have odd number of classrooms. So then they have to go down to kind of
1:00:09
that center. doesn't work on the screen. Uh it doesn't work on the screen. Um so
1:00:14
they kind of have to go down to the center of the building. Um which isn't really conducive to collaborative work.
1:00:19
So then um they have to send those kids up to the middle of the pod and it kind of ends up being they lose line of sight
1:00:25
and the kids wander and whatever middle schoolers, right? Um, so trying to use
1:00:30
some of the this as an opportunity to as we reorganize and move the administration utilizing that as a way
1:00:38
to get a classroom in to another pod as well as moving the art room. And what this does is it moves that
1:00:44
administration closer to the the parent drop off. Right now the parent drop off is kind of on the opposite side of the
1:00:51
administr where the administration sits and there is no secure entry to that administration. So if they come in, they
1:00:57
can kind of have free access to the entire building. We want to not do that anymore. So we're going to rearrange
1:01:03
that, move the administration down to the south, um pave kind of that whole uh area where the uh where the parent drop
1:01:10
off is at, create a proper queue uh for that so that way all the kiddos kind of
1:01:15
can access uh when they're getting dropped off. We aren't going to do anything with the bus drop off. That will still happen on the west side of
1:01:21
the school. Uh, but this does really start to hone in on making sure the logistics are proper at that middle
1:01:28
school and it really kind of funnels the kids. That was another thing we heard like when the when schools out, kids
1:01:33
just kind of scatter through there if they're not on a bus. Uh they we'll have parents that sit in the in the um in the
1:01:41
the neighborhoods and have their kids come out of the north side, the east side, the south side, kind of all over the place. So, we want to kind of
1:01:46
condense that and make everybody have a the same entry and exit. Um we'll have uh multiple mechanical system upgrades
1:01:53
here too. Um building envelope. This one has more uh tuck pointing that's needed. Um we're seeing some more maybe some
1:02:00
water infiltration around there. Uh as well as um the gym renovation. During
1:02:05
our our time, we heard a lot about um the stage and and needing some updates
1:02:10
to that area as well um for some ADA upgrades in that area. So we'll take
1:02:16
this opportunity to to do that as well.
1:02:21
So, as we get into the high school, we'll start with the site. Uh, the site logistics are a challenge here. Um, as
1:02:30
you guys kind of all know. Um, so there's going to be two states that you
1:02:35
see in this the the site planning of this. One is before Mustang Road comes
1:02:41
in on the west side, what do we do? Um, and then after Mustang Road comes in,
1:02:46
what does that look like? Um, so as we get into this, you'll also see when Mustang Road comes in, that's when we
1:02:53
would plan on upgrading the high school stadium because we don't want to bottleneck more people coming on the
1:03:00
west side of the building um that you already have. I've been to games here um and I know how how it gets really
1:03:07
crowded as you come through the west side of the building, but um so really what we're going to do is redo the kind
1:03:14
of the logistics of the parking. Um, we're going to go to a head-in parking system versus kind of the one way all
1:03:20
over the place. Um, create a single kind of lane that goes around. You you kind of have that now. Uh, but we want to
1:03:26
make sure that we have more of a a decision point so that way people don't end up in front of this building as
1:03:32
they're coming down the lane here. Um, we're also going to add some parking to the west side of the building, um, to
1:03:39
help gain some more parking spaces along the west side, kind of where your art rooms are at in that area, as well as
1:03:46
kind of wrapping around on the north side. Um, as we reorganize the high school, um, we'll have some opportunity
1:03:53
to, uh, capture some of that space on the north side as well.
1:04:00
Oh, sorry, one one other note. Um, we are gaining parking spaces. We're going from 820 to a little over a thousand. So
1:04:07
that is helpful as well. Um so as we work into So what you see on
1:04:14
the west side is kind of the conceptual version of Mustang rag. We know that they're still working on a lot of this
1:04:19
but this gives us a an idea of where to start on how how those things start to
1:04:24
work in. Um again we'll we'll have um head in parking. There's a roundabout.
1:04:32
There's a roundabout here that leads into Mustang Road. Y So you would no longer have your access
1:04:38
directly off of the highway. You funnel off of Mustang Road and have kind of two
1:04:43
points of entry and exit on Mustang Road, which will kind of help give you plus with the roadways kind of continue
1:04:50
to the north, it gives you two ways out, and right now you just have the one. So
1:04:55
it helps with some of that bottleneck issue. Yeah. Um, and then this is where we
1:05:00
would suggest bringing in uh the new stadium piece to it. Uh, you can see the
1:05:06
added parking kind of on the north side uh adjacent to the stadium as we rework the bleachers and everything else that
1:05:12
go along with that. And again, we we gain a little bit more
1:05:17
parking at this location at this juncture at um because we're gaining some of the parking on the north side at
1:05:23
1160 total. So, the high school itself, um, don't
1:05:31
give away our renderings, AJ. Come on, we want to save that. Uh, so the
1:05:36
reorganization of the high school becomes something that, um, I I remember walking into the one of the meetings and
1:05:43
having somebody say, I don't know how you guys are going to make this all feel like one campus. It's a mess right now.
1:05:49
Like, I don't know how you're going to do that. That's why you hire people like us so that way we can really look at this and
1:05:54
and vision that for you and help you with that. Um what we started to realize
1:05:59
is the classroom uh the classroom neighborhoods in the older section of the school were problematic as we
1:06:06
toured. Um the east side where Meadows used to be um is something that's much
1:06:12
more in tune to what we would see and we would design to nowadays in contemporary design. So, bringing the current high
1:06:20
school classrooms up to that level is what we were striving for in this. Um,
1:06:25
so what you see are two additions on the north and the south side. Kind of enclosing that and creating a courtyard.
1:06:31
And when I say a courtyard, it would be very low maintenance. We're not throwing
1:06:36
grass in there where you'd have to mow it. It is something more akin to the way that the the Oakview campus is utilizing
1:06:44
theirs. as far as the U materials there, not necessarily how they're utilizing
1:06:50
them, but um how we would envision those. Um along with that, um kind of a
1:06:56
complete renovation of the labs that sit down the center of the building um to
1:07:02
create more uh air uh more daylight that happens within there. Um really starting
1:07:07
to reorganize the building too and getting rid of some of the redundancy that you have right now. You have two kitchens and two cafeterias.
1:07:15
um where you see your old kitchen where we have SC FCS up there. We would remove that kitchen, expand the current kitchen
1:07:22
that was in Meadows and also expand the cafeteria, taking up that courtyard that you have that sits in between the two um
1:07:29
cross corridor uh pieces that were put in. So, we're creating a larger cafeteria space and taking up the old
1:07:36
library, making that your study hall space that would likely have, um, some pieces in there that have ultimate
1:07:42
flexibility that would, uh, communicate with the cafeteria expansion. Um, along with that, um, removing or
1:07:50
relocating the admin, uh, into one location so that way everybody sits in the same place. Um that was something
1:07:57
that was really um desired by a lot of the staff there to have all the
1:08:02
administration one place. Creating more cohesion and more collaborative opportunity for them was something that
1:08:08
was really important. And it also gives you an opportunity to have the main entry where everybody enters and exits
1:08:14
the building uh during classroom time. Um the library would be then re situated
1:08:21
where your current administration area is an addition put on there uh to create
1:08:26
something that is more akin to what a 1500 student um school would have and
1:08:32
then a complete renovation of the auditorium uh which would include AV and lighting um along with that um kind of a
1:08:39
complete finish upgrade in that location. career and technical education also gets um a lot of redistribution and
1:08:47
um addition there. So we would create a proper woods and metals lab uh within
1:08:54
that space that would really um have a lot of safety built into that, a lot of
1:08:59
uh space for for kids to have projects and and uh keep those in one place. Um
1:09:05
we would also include some of the other um career technical education spaces,
1:09:10
engineering um maker spaces, a labs, things of that nature that would happen
1:09:15
up there as well as a new greenhouse uh would sit up there as well. Um with the renovation of the locker room, um the
1:09:22
alternative high school piece would have to move uh and that would all happen um in when we were there were golf
1:09:28
simulators. Sounds like that's a really contested space in the high school of like who gets that space. So, we're just
1:09:34
going to give it to the alternative high school kiddos there. Uh, what that does is it gives them an opportunity to have their own space, um, their own entry and
1:09:41
exit and parking that's close to them as well, so they can they can utilize that area for their own.
1:09:48
Did I hit everything? I think I got everything. Oh, special education. I don't want to leave that out. Um, we're
1:09:55
creating a new special education area right now. It kind of sits on either side of that main hallway. We're going
1:10:02
to take that um put it into one space so that way we could have kind of an apartment style um piece to it, a living
1:10:09
space that they can gain life skills as well as a classroom uh an adaptive restroom uh which is really important
1:10:16
for those for that that particular piece. Um, and then when we remove that,
1:10:21
we have an opportunity to create some teacher collaboration spaces, which is how we gain uh the utilization in our in
1:10:28
our high school classrooms. Um, by teachers not owning their space. Um, it creates an easier way to schedule
1:10:35
things. Um, so that way we're we're scheduling more efficiently as we go through that process.
1:10:42
Okay. So now the renderings um this is the main
1:10:49
entry. Um as you look at the space uh at at this particular location, we're
1:10:55
trying to have some um muscle memory, right? You have the the red uh the red
1:11:01
piece here. U we're creating that again, right? We're identifying entry by the logo, by the red, by uh the larger
1:11:09
overhang. Um and as we create a little bit more green space and activity um
1:11:15
along the entry uh to really suggest this is where you come into the school.
1:11:21
As we look at the classroom pod um creating uh that collaborative space
1:11:28
that um was so desired by a lot of the staff that's here. Uh
1:11:34
having that um connection to nature. Um this is something that is uh really uh
1:11:40
really important for uh student outcomes and making sure that we get good collaborative space for all all the
1:11:46
kiddos there. Um on either side would be the new classroom uh pieces that would
1:11:52
align with what you currently have. Um about a 900 foot classroom give or take.
1:11:59
So overall this is kind of what the campus is reimagined to. You can see the
1:12:06
auditorium off to the very left um with the library edition um kind of in the
1:12:12
forefront. You can see the classroom addition on either side creating that courtyard in the middle that that
1:12:17
students can utilize um and be protected while they're there. And then the new main entry you can kind of see really
1:12:23
off to the the one side off into the distance. Um one thing that isn't noted
1:12:28
really is right down the middle you can see that big that taller space. Um, that's where we would pop up an area
1:12:35
where the labs are at to give that natural light. Even though we don't have natural or daylighter or views out, um,
1:12:43
we do have an opportunity to get some natural daylight into those spaces. So,
1:12:51
all right. So, this is our last slide. Um, we wanted to just sort of give you
1:12:56
the sum total um, you know, for that first phase and second phase. Um,
1:13:03
yeah. So, I guess maybe now we could just open it up for questions and see what you guys want to learn more about.
1:13:10
And again, we'll have the master plan wrapped up here in the next probably
1:13:16
month or so. Yeah. Um, we'll have that finalized and be able to get that over to Dr. Bloom and
1:13:22
um, get that out to you guys, too. So, you can see that document.
1:13:30
maybe just jump in with the high school. Um well, first thanks. I mean, this is really good stuff and I appreciate the
1:13:36
seven and a half months that I know you put a lot of hours into to getting here. So, good work. Um the the high school
1:13:44
and you you hit it really well. I mean, it's kind of Oak View and and the the
1:13:49
old high school. They don't look anything alike. They're abudded, but there's a completely different finish
1:13:54
pallet and finishes on the outside of both of them. They're the windows are different. So can you just kind of talk
1:14:01
about how you solve that particularly that that ephus problem that we've got on the high school and then you know I
1:14:08
suppose then you got this exterior finish pallet on the meadows that probably doesn't work either. So how do
1:14:14
you get to something that looks more cohesive and it doesn't look like two schools that were built and
1:14:19
buted up to each other? Yeah, the um I don't think we touched on it probably but
1:14:25
I can get into the weeds on that. So the high school during our facility condition assessment we noted that the
1:14:30
Ephus is failing and the splitface CMU which is the lower material is also
1:14:35
spalling off and has there's a lot of water infiltration into the wall there. Um so our recommendation what's included
1:14:41
in our pricing here is to pull all of it off. So we're adding additions you know to some areas which of course that'll
1:14:48
take care of the issue on the exterior there. We'll peel that back and get that removed. And then in areas that are
1:14:53
still to remain, we will pull it all off and replace it with likely with brick is
1:14:59
what we've included in our pricing. And um we'd like to take cues from Meadows
1:15:05
because the pallet's nice. It's got a soft feel. We can grab some of the the brick colors or some of the metal panel
1:15:11
colors from that building and begin to bring those around um the older parts of
1:15:16
the high school and the new additions so that it all feels more um cohesive. and
1:15:22
on the interior, you know, something to that sort as well. That's a little easier because you can, you know, with paint and carpet, you can begin to pull
1:15:29
things together a little more easily. So, it's a great question.
1:15:34
Can I just say thank you for I know when we went through this, we had a couple options and while people liked them, we
1:15:41
kind of went back and asked for something else and you guys came back with something that I'm really excited about. Um, so thank you for for taking
1:15:48
our input and and making those changes because I think it's I I like the third one. Um, I'm really excited for that.
1:15:53
So, thank you very much for doing that. Appreciate it. Yeah, we like the third one, too. We're excited by it.
1:16:01
Um, you said in your presentation that um at the schools that we touch, we will
1:16:08
include an in place of inclusive playground. Elementary schools. The elementary. So, but does that
1:16:15
because when you put information up, there were three schools that had them dictated,
1:16:21
right? But there are more than, right? Because what we're showing you is phase one right now. Okay.
1:16:27
So, those will happen when we do like I don't like when we do work at South Prairie in phase two. Um, that's when
1:16:34
we'll turn and and look at the inclusive playground there and so on and so forth. as we get into some of the site pieces
1:16:41
of those, we're trying to bundle projects that make sense that you get the best economy of scales and we work with DCI to understand what that looks
1:16:48
like. Um, so that's why you you don't see them in phase one on some of them because we're waiting to get um that
1:16:54
exterior work happening. So then we'll bring those in at those other schools obvious and there would obviously be
1:17:00
grading and drainage issues that would have to be addressed. Like I know at Northridge and at South Prairie they
1:17:06
have historically had issues with water on their facility. So
1:17:11
I assume when that construction would take place regardless the phase it would also address some of the water
1:17:18
collection issues that they have at those locations that and we've got some parking and paving that's happening at some of like
1:17:24
Heritage is or not Heritage um Northridge. Correct. Um we have some parking and paving uh that will take
1:17:29
care of some of that as well. Okay. Um, and as well as I think they've got some issues with a grease interceptor out
1:17:34
there. Um, smell kind of coming through the rest of the building. We figured out I think why that's happening. So, we're
1:17:39
going to address that and and some of that as well because we're trading off right with watershed and as we increase our hard
1:17:46
surfacing, we need to and I saw in several of the sketches there were designs to include um wetlands and water
1:17:54
catchment systems to hopefully help mitigate some of the water issues we've had. Yeah. and the high school I think is the
1:18:00
biggest u catchment to that. Um what we're what we're representing right now is some underground detention because
1:18:06
we're taking up a lot of your area out here for parking. So with that we're including that the
1:18:12
cost that we're showing here is including some underground attention to really handle some of what what the
1:18:17
you're having out here. Details are still um we'll have to work those out as we get into the project in and of itself
1:18:23
on you know where utilities cross and all that stuff. But as far as like the cost of it, we're capturing that and
1:18:29
understanding that that's something that will happen during the project.
1:18:35
So we talked about elementary schools with the playgrounds. Are we looking to do anything for the middle school? Not necessarily playground, but I know that
1:18:41
they have recess out there now. Is there anything added in that for the middle school? Yeah, I'll work with OPN or operations
1:18:48
on um Yeah. PreK6. So we want playgrounds inclusive, all of that to be
1:18:54
through sixth grade. Correct. Okay. Yep. Okay. Awesome. And then the parking spaces, it showed like a thousand something and like,00 is
1:19:01
that like you add those together, we're going to have like 21. No, it's I was like, that's a lot of spaces. I
1:19:06
mean, that'd be great, but Okay. So, it's like,00ish we're talking about
1:19:11
once you get in its final form. Got it. Okay. Thank you. For the new stadium seating, is it are
1:19:18
we adding on to the existing or is that like you'll tear it down? Yeah. Um adding on to bleachers is
1:19:25
really hard and your press box is in pretty rough shape. So um bringing in a new press box
1:19:31
and bringing in new bleacher systems on both um home and visitor side. Um along
1:19:36
with that in that first kind of phase we're showing um the uh team room locker
1:19:43
room um as we as we get into that. So that will already be in place when um
1:19:48
the bleachers come in. So, I guess we probably didn't really touch on that a whole lot, but that is something that we
1:19:54
will do during that first phase of getting that construction happening out
1:19:59
there. Are those sized to where we have to have an elevator to the press box or did you
1:20:05
keep it under Well, I think it's under 500 square feet is what we have to have. So, if you have to have one, you have to have one. If
1:20:10
you guys want more than 500 square feet, which most want more than that, um, we we'll have to bring in an elevator for
1:20:16
that. You put 200 499 square foot box. We can do that, but you can't split
1:20:22
them. You can't have two home and away press boxes again. Yeah, you can't do that. It's It's a collective total. I've
1:20:27
already tried to play that game. It doesn't work. Well, we've we've got a a more accommodating city partner than a lot of
1:20:33
towns. I mean, I can't hear that. Like,
1:20:41
great. Any other questions? Good work. I I'm sorry, just one more
1:20:47
thing. And just uh for those of us who maybe don't live in the construction world um and have never experienced
1:20:55
water damage like in their home, the water that you spoke about that's
1:21:01
between the facade and the brick at the high school is absolutely something that we have to address.
1:21:07
Yes. And if we don't address it, very bad things will happen. Absolutely. the facade of your building
1:21:13
will fall off at some point. And when you I know not everybody has the opportunity to go to the facilities
1:21:21
committee meetings because we all have busy lives. Um when you did your
1:21:26
facility um inspections, you happen to note that there was substantial damage.
1:21:33
It'll be in your it'll be in the report. Um substantial is probably not the right word, but it is it is something that
1:21:39
needs to be taken care of. Yeah, I think that is something that we have identified as like a concern that you
1:21:45
should take care of that very um and looking at the existing building drawings. I mean I can talk to you afterwards if you'd like and we'll get
1:21:51
into how how that works but yes it is something that has to be taken care of and we wouldn't want to like make the inside pretty and not fix that.
1:21:58
Right. Very good. I just want to make sure that's on the record. Thank you. Sorry, really quick. These funds that we're talking about here because these
1:22:04
are probably big numbers that people are seeing. Is this part bond, part pebble,
1:22:09
part save? I'm guessing this is a combination of everything. Correct. Great question. All of the above. Yep.
1:22:14
So, what OP and DCI done a heck of a job is you're seeing a list of projects over
1:22:21
anywhere from next year to 10 years. and we collectively will decide what goes in
1:22:27
the November bond, which we think we have a pretty good account for, but then also what will be the staging and the
1:22:34
timeline of using PPE and save dollars for various projects that to be honest we may want to move up because it can't
1:22:40
get done in a bond for three or four years or yep because we're able to put it in a bond save
1:22:48
and now we can go get something in year five because we've able to save that and now can do it. So, it is a combination
1:22:55
of all of them and also probably a good time for us to share as soon we're going
1:23:01
to go knock on doors because this is a big deal that you know I I will say it a million times
1:23:08
your your taxes could go up or down because of life valuations
1:23:14
just different school stuff, city stuff, but this bond will not do that to you,
1:23:21
right? So, like I we're going to have to do a good job of seeing a big number and thinking, "Oh my gosh, did I just pay
1:23:27
something different? My property taxes are XY." Like, we we'll help coach people on No, we're talking very
1:23:33
different buckets of money, very different ways of of paying for things. our our teachers salaries are not
1:23:40
impacted by any of the like it's it's something that's very much needed and
1:23:45
and this is a way that we can go about it and spread some things over time and
1:23:51
you know still take care of our constituents and and our families. So I that's part of our homework is they're
1:23:56
not please don't think this just raised anything for you. It's just not the case.
1:24:05
I think maybe just an observation and I think when we've done this in the past it's been pretty focused on a particular
1:24:10
facility and so we've gone and done some conceptual design and raised the money
1:24:16
and then gone and executed. I think you guys have done a really nice job looking across the district, understanding what
1:24:22
kind of demand we have just in terms of um, you know, cap capital renewal need,
1:24:29
but then also doing net new work across the district, but then looking at phase
1:24:34
one and two running concurrently, but then overlapping to some degree. that really helps us because we can only
1:24:41
influence so much of the high school at a time because we still need to be able to conduct school and there's so much we
1:24:46
can get done between you know whatever it is the last day of May and the first uh or the 20th day of August or
1:24:53
something like that. So, I think this really helps us get our head around, you
1:24:58
know, kind of the the spread, the impact, but then I think it also helps build that story around doesn't matter
1:25:04
where your kiddos at, you know, between optional kindergarten and 12, it's, you know, you're going to benefit from this
1:25:11
thing certainly, you know, in the short term and then relatively quickly across nearly every school we have. So, I think
1:25:19
that helps um sell the bond idea for sure. I appreciate and I think it's important
1:25:24
to add too as we do our homework with our families like this stuff is going to look really cool. The pictures are going to be pretty. The final product's going
1:25:30
to be gorgeous, but these are needs. This isn't this isn't a wish list. Like we have got to have three more secure
1:25:39
buildings, right? People can't we we've got to do that. Our we're at 99
1:25:44
something% capacity at our high school, right? Some of our growth has declined, but it remember
1:25:50
that's elementary there. the the middle school up is still there. Like these things truly become necessities. They're
1:25:57
going to look great, but we're we're not trying to do these projects because we
1:26:02
think it'll look cool. Like these are absolute needs to help our kids, our staff, and our families,
1:26:08
you know? I mean, you've driven around that parking lot. Dear God, like just do the parking lot tomorrow and we'll vote
1:26:16
yes. So, it'll be fun. like the renderings that we're showing are what it could look like. We have to go
1:26:21
through the process with the stu the school itself to understand what their needs are. So, it could look a little
1:26:27
different when we're done, but um we're designing a little bit in a vacuum here, which is fun, but it's it may not it may
1:26:34
not look like that when we're all said and done, but we're going to try to keep true to what we have thus far. So,
1:26:39
and I want to share before you guys go, thanks for coming again. The OPN DCI teams have been tremendous partners.
1:26:46
They're so responsive. They've let all of these meetings get our feedback.
1:26:51
They've dealt with me saying, "Well, but try this and what if that and so they've been a lot of fun and hopefully this
1:26:59
moves forward. We'll we'll do some more neat things together." So, we thank you both. Yeah, it's been a lot of fun working with you guys. So, we're looking forward
1:27:04
to the next step. Yeah. Great. Thanks everybody. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.
1:27:10
Well, up Nick, you didn't even get one pre-con question, so you're out of here. Scot-free. Good job.
1:27:18
All right, we'll move on to reports. Uh we don't have any uh written reports or building level reports typically in the
1:27:24
month of uh July. So we'll move along to Dr. Kenza. Well, good evening everyone. Dr. Bloom,
1:27:30
do you want to introduce our special guest at tonight's board meeting? Yep. I'm excited. We uh you know, we've had a couple folks start July 1 and so
1:27:38
pumped that Allison got to hang out with us tonight. So she is here can say hi and I don't know if she's got to take off after this but um Allison Finley is
1:27:45
our new director of student services. So she has been shoot hired you know a few
1:27:50
months ago and doing two jobs at once at times it feels like but she's been awesome to have around. Um so just
1:27:57
wanted to introduce you know our new director of student service to the board and you'll see a lot of Allison and
1:28:03
Allison I think you'll like this crew as well. So welcome. We're pumped to have you. Welcome to DCG.
1:28:11
Okay. Well, yes, she's been already hit the ground running, been a great member of our team. So, thank you, Alan.
1:28:16
Um, a couple of just updates. First off, um, our new teacher orientation is right
1:28:21
around the corner now. It's hard to believe. I just can't believe every time I sit here and share this. So, in your packet, you have a copy of just our new
1:28:28
teacher orientation. Uh, that was put together. Uh, Mrs. Olsen, our director
1:28:34
of teaching and learning, has put that together. But I also want to shout out I know um Jamie and human resources and
1:28:40
Carrie uh what you don't see on this schedule is that they also have three um
1:28:45
what would be optional sessions ahead of this to come in and to get their computer to get all set up and that was
1:28:52
a part of just feedback that they took from those participants in years past. So that is also in the days leading up
1:28:59
to like July 30th, August 6th and maybe right before. So, um, you know, please,
1:29:04
uh, join us when you can for I know I think Miss Olsson included some information in the packet about lunchons
1:29:09
that you're welcome to join if you can for the new teachers. It's always great to introduce them to you as board members.
1:29:16
Um, all staff pre-ervice days is the next packet that you have. So, we have two documents. One is the showing of the
1:29:22
classified staff and one is the really all staff, although classified would be
1:29:28
a little bit in that one. What you can see is um we have a full week so five
1:29:33
days before school starts and we have that mix of building professional development where buildings will get to
1:29:39
lead with the content that they need. We also will have teacher work time in there. Um we'll also have some very
1:29:46
targeted professional development for some of our student services groups which is important so that we can set
1:29:52
them off on the right track and the right foot and make sure they have a goal. You'll see some curriculum meetings with interventionists and our
1:29:59
career and technical education and then Mrs. Olsen will lead some teachers in some professional development around um
1:30:05
English language arts and and and standards. Uh Mr. Just has put together
1:30:10
for us classified staff schedule. So, thank you for sharing that Carrie. Um we'll have everybody together at the all
1:30:16
district in service. Then we'll kind of split. Associates will also have uh plenty of time in their buildings to be
1:30:22
able to um get trained alongside the principles to talk about procedures and all that. So I I really want to
1:30:29
recognize I mean the district as a whole and that involves all of the senior leadership and the principles that is a
1:30:35
commitment of time and um while it it will move very very fast I feel like
1:30:40
we've we've done a nice job of covering and preparing for all of those teacher groups that we've talked about. So
1:30:46
questions about those two documents, back to school days. All right. Um next
1:30:51
is state and federal reporting. So June July is pretty quiet. Um but that doesn't mean things aren't happening
1:30:57
behind the scenes. So as we said, um we just do a final review at the end of June to make sure all of our reports in
1:31:03
inside um the ED portal are complete. Um we'll look at I've done kind of a study
1:31:08
of what are all the reports due here for July, August, and September. So that we're planning ahead. Um we've I've done
1:31:16
some tweaking of like a user guide that we're working to create so people um you know anytime we have add people into
1:31:23
state reporting they'll understand where to go for all the information and then also um Carrie and Jamie uh his
1:31:30
administrative assistant will be working to prepare for fall beds uh which will hit in October and that's the collection
1:31:36
of information around staff and we also have done gotten our annual
1:31:42
notifications prepared um and other uh notices for for staff. First up in
1:31:48
August, you'll hear me talk about graduate verification. So, we'll make sure to verify with the state all kids
1:31:53
who graduated, whether it was in May was they walked across or earlier, but also maybe we've had some students over the
1:31:59
summer that have earned some credits. So, and uh then we'll do some accounting for for courses. And lastly, the big
1:32:07
document is this um pretty large hope I didn't print it out, but I did. um our
1:32:12
school improvement plan. This is uh as you know, we've kind of built into this over the past couple of months. So, our
1:32:20
school improvement planning started in late April, early uh May. Uh our teachers have done an incredible job. We
1:32:27
brought to you at the last board meeting our district goals. Um and so now what
1:32:32
you are seeing is the production of each building's professional or each building's annual goal for the year. And
1:32:40
then as you move through the packet, it transitions into our professional development calendar. Um, so you can see
1:32:46
in there, this is our Wednesdays at a glance, which I think I've shared with you previously, or I hope I did. Um, if
1:32:52
you'll notice on the far right, we have our classified staff as well. So, which day, what are the days that they're
1:32:58
getting trained throughout the year. And then lastly is, and I want to stress those last documents, they look like
1:33:04
this. This is just a road map. It is it is not a formal document but teams were
1:33:10
asked to start to think about and plan out what will happen at each month with regards to professional development.
1:33:17
Some took the liberties of putting every single thing that may happen over the course of the year. Others are more
1:33:22
broad just to know hey this is when we can prep prepare for professional development. Um the high school one is
1:33:28
blank not because they didn't do it. Um with their new changeover of leadership we wanted to make sure um uh Mr.
1:33:35
Blackmore had the chance to be able to work with his teams. So there now that their goals are set, which are in the
1:33:41
packet, they're able to start putting together their roadmap. So hopefully uh it's both an accountability tool for
1:33:48
buildings. It is if something changes, hey, no problem. They can be flexible with their PD. Um but I would tell you
1:33:54
just from this seat, I appreciate now more than ever understanding what they're working on as a building and
1:33:59
what their goals are. Um so that as administrators at this level, we can support them. But I I would I would be
1:34:06
remiss if I didn't recognize those building leadership teams that have put a lot of time in over the summer and
1:34:11
maybe at the end of the school year. So, um questions about the building goals that you see. Um notice that they're all
1:34:17
different. Some may have two building goals and that's appropriate. That's based on their data and their needs and
1:34:23
what they're focusing on. Some might have four that align with each of our four uh district goals. But even if they
1:34:30
have two or they have three or they have four, they're still also working to support our district goals.
1:34:38
This is great. Thank you. I found this to be a really interesting um process to see from last year when we
1:34:46
were starting all of this professional development to like where it is now. Um and this is something that's very new
1:34:52
to me. I've never seen anything like this. Um, and this
1:34:57
just has to be like a huge lift. And I feel like everyone that has participated
1:35:03
in this has done so much work, but like been excited about it. And that's really heartening to see. Um, and not only the
1:35:11
way of of team building within their their professional learning communities, but at the building and then also at the
1:35:18
district. It's just it's just been fascinating and amazing. So, thank you. Well, thank you, Meg. I appreciate that
1:35:23
and I accept that on behalf of all the individuals who created this. It is not a oneperson um fits all. What I think
1:35:29
we've done is tried to honor, you know, we've involved them in crafting the district goals. Um and now we've
1:35:35
involved their building teams and every building has a different flavor and a different need. So I think that's
1:35:41
reflected in here. I love the addition of our strategic plan. I don't I don't know. So just for one
1:35:47
second I would just say I think it's the first time that I felt coherence just even from my role of knowing hey what
1:35:54
every place is doing and how it builds from level to level. Um they'll be responsible through SCAK and other
1:36:00
methods for reporting out their progress towards their building goals. We'll come back but I I think we're seeing uh
1:36:07
really good improvements in both the teaching and the learning side. Our teachers often say hey I just want to
1:36:13
know where we're going. they can they can understand and they've been supportive. So hopefully this is clear
1:36:18
to them and that they've had a voice in it. So thank you. Appreciate it. I think it speaks volumes about the
1:36:24
culture that that exists here and and that's just it's really well done Greg
1:36:30
and thank you very much. We appreciate that.
1:36:36
Anything else for Greg? Ditto. Oh, Dr. Ditto for me too, Greg.
1:36:43
Thank you, sir. Right. All right. Uh, thank you team. Nine building permits, one single family in
1:36:49
Dallas Center, and then three single family permits and Grimes and five town home permits. So, that's nine. And we'll
1:36:56
take them. And again, thankful for the city of Grimes coming tonight. A couple months ago, we had Dallas Center and
1:37:02
hopefully uh both are up to up to par getting some more houses and town homes
1:37:08
and apartments. Love it. So, exciting stuff. My facilities updates again to thank OPN for their hard work in DCI and
1:37:16
thankful for the uh facilities team. We will meet tomorrow as a facilities team if anyone's interested because at that
1:37:22
time we will kind of talk about really some of the big picture things that will make it into the bond um and really talk
1:37:29
about next steps with that. we will need uh approximate number about 600
1:37:34
signatures to get the bond to even come to you all on the 25th of August to
1:37:40
approve that it can be a uh you know an item at the November election. So that
1:37:46
team because I can't go knock on doors and our team can't say please vote yes
1:37:51
and here's all the reasons why. We can give a lots of good information but um our facilities team and hopefully their
1:37:57
their friends will actually be on the ground um you know knocking on doors in Dallas Center in and Grimes getting
1:38:04
signatures telling them the the reasons why we need this and do all that. So, we'll kind of tackle that next step
1:38:10
starting tomorrow and then on the 25th of August come to you hopefully for approval of putting the bond language on
1:38:17
the ballot in November and then it's hopefully show all the reasons why we need it. Um, the other shout out I want
1:38:23
to give is to uh Sean and Travis. Um, they just there's a lot going on this
1:38:28
summer even though we don't have big building projects. That's actually a good thing because they have just knocked out a bunch of stuff. And I want
1:38:36
to give tons of credit to the operations team, to the custodial team, Jeff and transportation. Um I had a principal um
1:38:44
call me today simply to say in in her years in the district, she's never seen
1:38:49
this much stuff get done over the summer in her building and beyond. So that's a
1:38:54
credit to um those folks that are in those buildings every day keeping it clean, reorganizing classrooms, and then
1:39:00
just knocking out a bunch of projects. So uh just thanks thanks to the facilities team and all the hard work
1:39:06
that happens over the summer. And then just a quick update on enrollment. We're
1:39:12
going to find all the positives we can. So our resident student enrollment went
1:39:17
up about 14. So, still down right from October 1st of last year, but it it went
1:39:24
up and and so hopefully August sometimes brings us a few more. Um, so that's a
1:39:30
positive. And also want to want to share we're we're up um 30-ish or so at this
1:39:36
time. And again, we're using last week's numbers um so stuff can change, but we're up about 30 open enrolled students
1:39:43
as well. So we we've have an increase there um from from our last couple
1:39:49
years. So that's that's a good thing. So there's kind of your hard numbers as of the uh 17th. Um so we'll uh at our
1:39:57
August 12th meeting, we'll have a hopefully some even updates from there. So got Allison on my notes there, but we
1:40:04
knocked that out. So yay. Welcome Allison again. So um with that, I think
1:40:10
that's my short and sweet. Any questions I can answer? So, overall we're still down 43.
1:40:18
Yes. I just Yep. Exactly. Yep. Thank you. I just want to make sure. Thank you. Yep.
1:40:25
All right, Miss Warmouth. Uh, at the beginning of the fiscal year, I always do a levy review so that you
1:40:33
are aware of the different levies in place um that the taxpayers are contributing to. Our overall levy rate
1:40:40
for the 2526 school year is $18.15.
1:40:46
That is comprised of um the general fund at a total of9 $9.86
1:40:53
per thousand um which includes the instructional support levy at $18 and
1:41:01
$8.78 in the uh support of the combined district cost at the general fund.
1:41:07
Beyond that, the management fund uh is $2.58. Remember, management covers insurance,
1:41:14
early retirement, unemployment, equipment breakdown, um and this year, uh the pooling cost
1:41:21
for natural gas. Uh also, uh the $45
1:41:27
on various bonds that are listed here with their retirement dates listed. So,
1:41:33
we are paying a pre-levy of $2.5 million, which will uh reduce the cost
1:41:41
or or the time length of that Heritage Elementary bond, which is scheduled for 3435 and will likely end earlier than
1:41:49
that. So, it's prudent action the board takes to pay off some of that debt early as it has ability to do so. Should there
1:41:57
be a bond issue in November, um that pre- levy would go away and that funding
1:42:03
would go towards payment of principal and interest of those new bonds, noting that that $45 would not increase. That
1:42:11
would be the same level uh should it u move forward and pass uh
1:42:17
an additional bond for the district. And finally, voted PPE. As you remember in
1:42:22
March this year, our voted PPE was renewed. We have a total of $167
1:42:28
for the board approved PELE and voter approved PPE that supports um several
1:42:33
repair and maintenance busing or bus purchases uh technology purchases across
1:42:39
the district for facility improvements. Do you have any questions about the levies that are in place for our
1:42:45
district? That's all I have for you tonight.
1:42:51
Thank you. All right, we'll move along then to old business. We've got the second reading
1:42:57
of uh a variety of policies here. Looking for a motion.
1:43:04
Move to approve. Dickinson second. Vella. Any discussion?
1:43:09
I know that we heard um Denise speak to the legality regarding the removal of
1:43:16
protected classes from our district policy and how um that isn't necessarily
1:43:23
written into the legislation but um is clearly a move that we have
1:43:30
been advised to make. I'm just curious if we could have a little bit of clarification on that. Absolutely. Yep. Thanks M for the
1:43:36
question. So, um, I appreciate Denise very much and we know there's there's others that probably have the same
1:43:43
sentiment and feelings towards. So, hopefully I can share a little bit about what we've worked hard the last couple
1:43:49
years, right, starting with our legal guidance is really try to to stay in line with them as much as possible. One
1:43:55
of my, I think, favorite things about working with with Allers is, you know, they're not coming from a
1:44:02
place of emotion with guidance. They're not coming from a political windfall. they're really after taking care of the
1:44:09
school district, right? And and they would specifically say the the school board, their their goal, right, is to
1:44:15
quote unquote limit risk for you all as schoolboard members and and us as a district. So, that being said, um part
1:44:22
of the legal guidance from our attorneys as related to this specific policy is a
1:44:28
couple things if I could share. Um, one is as a general rule of thumb, speaking a little bit for for allers in their
1:44:34
guidances, you know, um, it's it's probably not prudent of a school
1:44:40
district to add liability. In this case, if you are adding, um, a protected class
1:44:47
into a state law that that does not recognize that. And again, I'm I'm giving you
1:44:53
shared information. This is not Scott Bloom's feelings about what's a protected class that it would not be
1:44:59
good practice for the school district to add liability. And that goes in with with maybe kind of the second item is if
1:45:07
it's not protected our our legal guidance and and remember this is the same group that represents a lot of
1:45:13
school districts. they are giving this same information out to others is
1:45:19
you as a board are going to have a really really tough time and probably an inappropriate time trying to pick and
1:45:25
choose what becomes a protected class. So if
1:45:30
you have gender identity and a and a student or family comes and says we want
1:45:35
to be a protected class because we are X, it's going to be tough for the board
1:45:41
to say no, we're not going to protect that class but this class. And each time
1:45:46
you say yes, you are increasing your liability. Okay, so again they they are
1:45:52
coming clearly from a liability um standpoint. Um,
1:45:58
also I wanted like this is where I think some trust of our community members um,
1:46:03
probably come into play. Our team hears me say this all the time. Two things can be true at once. We can
1:46:11
absolutely follow the laws, deal with what was removed, and still
1:46:18
100% take care of and protect our kids. Our bullying harassment stuff didn't change. In fact, remember state law
1:46:24
removed all of those classes from bullying and harassment law. So, so gone are the days of I was bullied and
1:46:30
harassed by race, sexual orientation, gender, etc. Now it's I was bullied and
1:46:36
harassed and like we just do what we need to do as educators to take take
1:46:42
care of those students. Um, so my my quick summary Megan team is
1:46:48
Allers is telling us very clearly you're still protecting these kids. You have an
1:46:54
obligation to protect all students. Do that. But from a liability standpoint,
1:47:00
adding language into a policy that is not protected by a state law just is
1:47:06
something that gets maybe a little scary when you're just strictly talking school board. Um, you
1:47:15
know, liability issues and picking and choosing classes. And if I could end with and then answer any more of your
1:47:20
questions. I I love Denise to pieces and I'm gonna hopefully I need to be very careful I
1:47:26
don't misquote this but I had a little bit of respectful disagreement when she said something to the effect earlier
1:47:31
this today by removing gender identity that means these students will be ignored there there is something along
1:47:38
those lines and I just wholeheartedly disagree I know these bus drivers these
1:47:44
associates these principles these teachers folks here like no one's getting ignored like it all
1:47:51
students are going to be loved and cared for by our credible staff. And when it kids step out of bounds, we better hope
1:47:58
coach them up, teach them up, hold them accountable, etc. The this state law is not going to
1:48:05
impact the way we do business every single day. It may impact a policy. it will not have any detriment because I
1:48:12
know the people that are going to make sure that regardless of your race, gender identity, male, female, you name
1:48:19
100 others, you're going to want to come to DCG and be loved and cared for. So that's just
1:48:25
and again I I know that's a trust and kind of sappy, but that's what we're going to do. So me, I hope that that
1:48:31
answers a little bit of the the legal advice of why they would say don't add
1:48:36
liability. So thank you. You bet. Thank you. So I understand the advisement to
1:48:46
have similar verbiage as what would be recommended from IASB, right? from.
1:48:54
So I I now kind of I want to be cautious, but could you tell or speak to
1:49:00
then um you said there will be no more bullying um due to race or no more
1:49:08
bullying reported due to disability. But yet I would think as a practice and as a
1:49:14
system knowing where and the type of bullying that's occurring is an important thing
1:49:21
for us to monitor. Yeah. So we can be responsive as a system. And
1:49:27
I I know my role is to steer and not row.
1:49:32
And so I don't want to dictate what that looks like, but what sort of discussions
1:49:38
then are we having as a system on how we are going to track and provide that information to
1:49:46
our community. Sure. to ensure that we are still
1:49:51
protecting the students in our population. Y who do experience that um
1:49:59
because there are many things that are being removed, religion. Um right,
1:50:05
age. Yep. Right. National origin. And I think we want as you said um for students to feel
1:50:14
welcome Yep. in our school community. Great question. And I hope I if I understand you, Nancy. So what I think
1:50:20
the the optimist in me is right now, let's do it. Let's do a formal bullying complaint. So a parent or a student
1:50:26
fills out the a complaint, goes to Greg, Gail, principal, they they kind of do the investigation. Right now, previously
1:50:34
to have part of the the the check boxes for a founded case, it would need to meet one of those categories. Were you
1:50:41
bullied and harassed repeatedly because of your gender identity, because of your age, etc. kind of those rules went away which
1:50:47
potentially I would argue maybe helps right that there isn't this criteria so
1:50:54
to speak of this category is happening no are you being repeatedly bullying
1:50:59
harass creating an unsafe environment the the categories almost don't matter which I'm going to I'm going say is a
1:51:06
positive thing that being said I'm sure people will fill out we we encourage
1:51:11
them to fill out these these forms and they're going to state why, right? I was
1:51:17
bullied and harassed by X person and this is what happened. This was the language used. This was the treatment
1:51:23
used. So, we're we can still track that, right? It's not going to be like someone's still going to say their
1:51:29
reasons why and will have that information. They just don't have to
1:51:34
have that criteria met for bullying harassment. And when Greg goes to the state reporting, I'm just assuming the
1:51:41
state's then not going to say, "Okay, DCG, you had how many reported cases, how many were founded, and check these
1:51:48
boxes. How many were race related? How many there's just not going to be that piece? I I still envision the the Greg
1:51:56
and Bloom internal piece of this is how many we got. This was founded and and
1:52:01
here's kind of why that that is why I say our dayto-day is not changing. that
1:52:06
is that is still a practice we will continue and and I would I would just add he was
1:52:11
right on uh yes so by removing each of those uh indicators it generally just
1:52:18
broadens it right so it's repeated and targeted and then you know we know that
1:52:23
bullying makes it um hostile environment and so on so we're going to continue to
1:52:29
investigate every case could a student be bullied or harassed based on any one
1:52:34
of those factors Um, yes, that could still happen. Um, we what I really want
1:52:39
to say is we're still going to get around. We have we're going to go out and present to coaches right during like back to school week. We have signed up
1:52:46
and ask every building to do a sign up. Um, we're going to talk to students. Uh, we're looking at having a studentled
1:52:52
group. So, I don't I don't think that takes away nothing about these changes. While I understand the nature and
1:52:57
people's comments and feelings, uh it's not going to take away from the fact that we will still um vehemently pursue
1:53:04
those cases as they come in. Um we can keep all that data because we'll have all of the interviews and all of the
1:53:10
information. It's just on the bottom line with the state report, I would suspect is whereas we've had to identify
1:53:16
each of those indicators, we wouldn't I'm guessing that won't be a part of state reporting, but everything about
1:53:22
bullying and harassment reporting will still be kept in great detail. And I I want to compliment um the
1:53:30
district. They've done a lot to be responsive to bullying. Uh I think the addition of the independent investigator
1:53:37
has been a wise choice as well as the online form um to really put the power
1:53:43
in the hands of the people that are impacted. I would also just really like to encourage us as a board to keep tabs
1:53:50
on those categories um and to not turn a blind eye because while our state may
1:53:57
have elected to remove those things, I do know that there were a number of legislators that were very concerned
1:54:03
about the removal of this language. Um, and we do not live in a place that is
1:54:10
void of racism or abbleism or anti-semitism.
1:54:18
And we have a responsibility to be informed when that's happening and
1:54:24
to be proactive instead of retroactive. And so I would just like to continue
1:54:30
that conversation and would like to figure out a plan for having those same
1:54:35
sorts of great updates that you've been providing us in the past about situations and circumstances whether
1:54:41
it's in a public meeting or because of the nature of the data. Yep. A closed
1:54:48
work meeting. I just I think that it's very important that we have tangible
1:54:53
actions that show that while we're working to comply and
1:54:58
to minimize district liability, we are still very faithfully supporting
1:55:04
all of the students that attend our schools. And I appreciate those comments so much. And we have an ethical obligation to use
1:55:12
that data that we gather locally, state reporting wise to then look at trends
1:55:18
and patterns and to decide, hey, when we we can look at any one of our buildings, I have it already in a Google form. I,
1:55:25
you know, I could certainly share out how what that looks like or the factors that I collect. Hey, we're looking at 15
1:55:31
of these incidences are happening in a classroom, in a hallway, at lunch, cyber
1:55:36
bullying, any of those forms. And if we aren't acting on that data, then we're doing something very wrong. And we have
1:55:42
so far acted on that. And I understand that sometimes it appears by a student basis, right, that student has bullied.
1:55:49
And so we think of it as that one. But we have an obligation to educate. So you've summarized it very very well, but
1:55:56
also know that we have a commit from commitment from us and from Gail who holds us accountable in following up,
1:56:03
you know, to make sure that we're we're using that data to improve our practices. Y I appreciate that. Thank you, Nancy.
