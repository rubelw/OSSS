0:42
Um, Miss Wearmouth, is anyone registered to speak this evening? No one is registered to speak. Okay. Moving on to item four. Any um
0:50
changes to the agenda? Dr. Bloom board, we've got one change to the agenda under consent agenda um letter F.
0:58
We are exciting news. We're moving classroom clinic from uh one of our buildings to five of our buildings,
1:04
which is neat and for no cost, but we don't have the updated contract as of today like we are hoping. So, we need to
1:11
cross that off consent agenda and we will bring it back to you uh at our next meeting.
1:17
All right. So when we just raised the motion for consent to just please amend the the motion to that effect if you
1:24
would. Y thank you. Uh looking for a motion to uh for the
1:30
approval of the agenda as amended. Move to approve the agenda with as
1:37
amended or without item as amended is good. Okay. Y second quant. Any discussion?
1:44
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I oppose. same sign. Motion carries. Uh I
1:50
think we have everyone here from uh Pulk County and uh Prairie Meadows. So, thank you for joining us this evening, but if
1:56
you'd like to come to the lectern,
2:04
thank you very much. Thank you. U my name is Brian Oelco. Uh
2:10
I'm the president CEO at Prairie Meadows and I'm with Jill. I'll let Jill uh
2:16
introduce herself uh with the Pulk County uh Board of Supervisors. Uh I
2:22
just want to start by saying that uh Prairie Meadow's relationship with Pulk County uh is uh uh highly uh u important
2:33
to the community in terms of distributing uh back proceeds uh from uh
2:40
revenue received at Prairie Meadows Casino. Prey Meadows is one of two nonprofit casinos in the country. It was
2:48
something that was unique to Iowa uh when gaming was established in 1989.
2:54
And we have seen hundreds of millions of dollars returned back into the community
3:00
uh through the hard work of our employees and through uh the
3:06
contributions through our customers. And so this is one of my favorite times of year when Jill and I get an opportunity
3:12
to go out and and and distribute uh some of those revenues that are received. And
3:18
so I just want to say thank you for having us here. I appreciate this opportunity. I'm going to turn it over
3:24
to Jill. Hello. Thank you for having us. Jill Alterer. I'm your PK County Supervisor.
3:31
So the partnership that we have with Prairie Meadows in extending the money is a per capita perk county student
3:37
that's in the school district and since 2007 we have expended over $21.6 million
3:43
throughout the students in P County. This year is over $1.3 million alone. So like Brian said, this is an exciting
3:49
time to be able to come out and and give you guys some money that's unencumbered that you're able to use for your
3:55
projects because like us, you're setting your budget right now. Um, it's also a super exciting time because last time
4:01
when I was here, I was here for the the my first ever check presentation.
4:07
This time I'm here using this check for the first ever time. Somebody doesn't like me very much. Can you imagine me on
4:13
a windy day carrying this around like it still has the corners on it. I'm like, screw it. I'm just going to go with it.
4:18
Right. So, for you guys today, we are presenting healthy. Yeah. I need two.
4:25
I can't make a stairway for $31,98364
4:32
and my favorite is always the 64 cents because we don't round. That's what you guys have here. So, we're excited to
4:38
present that. You know, we talked about the partnership with Pt County and Prairie Meadows. What you're also going
4:45
to see is this growing partnership between the new leaderships, right? We had new leadership change last year with
4:51
the supervisors. We have new leadership change this year with Prairie Meadows. and we're just really excited as we have been meeting and planning and talking
4:58
about all the things that we're trying to bring to the community that the two of us can do together. One thing that I'm passionate about that Brian knows I
5:04
can't go almost anywhere without seeing is combating human trafficking. And I see that that's something that, you
5:09
know, schools and and and everyone should be able to get interested in and see what we can do to take that on.
5:15
Another one I was talking about earlier is a mobile clothing trailer to get out there for students that are in need. So,
5:20
we have exciting projects that we're going to be bringing forward to you. We're working on them now, but I just want you to know that our partnership
5:26
goes beyond Monday and Tuesday nights when we go out and present checks. So, thanks for taking the time to have us
5:31
here tonight. Do you have anything to add? I do need a picture otherwise my media team gets really angry and they want to
5:37
see this big check. Like, we can all duck behind the check, right? We could probably have 20 kids back here and they
5:42
won't even see them. Do you guys have any questions for us? All right. Well, let us Thank you very much. Yeah.
5:51
So maybe if the board wants to maybe get in front of the logo and then we'll get a picture with Brian and Jill if that's
5:57
okay.
6:05
And I also brought the check that
6:14
he didn't look nearly as trustworthy.
6:40
Thank you. Thank you.
6:47
I'm doing okay.
7:07
Yeah. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Jill.
7:12
Yeah. We want to Yeah. We want to express our gratitude
7:17
to Pulk County and u and Prairie Meadows for taking the time to come out and present that. They do that every year
7:23
and I know they've got a lot of rounds to make. So, it's very nice of them to come and do that. We certainly
7:28
appreciate the contribution. Uh we'll move along to item six, uh approval of minutes of previous meeting. Just one

8:43
with us this evening. So, Deb, April, Patty, and Diane, if you wouldn't mind coming up.
8:50
All right. Teachers, you can come up, too, I think.
8:55
Well, good evening. I'll introduce myself and then let the other principles introduce themselves. I'm Deb Kale. Um
9:01
I'm the Dallas Center Elementary uh principal and also the district preschool director. Patty Morris,
9:08
principal at South Prairie. April Heightland, principal at Northridge Elementary.
9:14
Diane Williamson, principal at Heritage Elementary. And this is my last schoolboard meeting I get to attend.
9:23
All right. So, um, we have teachers from every one of the elementary buildings
9:28
tonight who are very supportive. I'm trying to use the language of our vision
9:34
statements. So, we have teachers from every elementary building tonight who are very supportive of the
9:40
implementation of our new curriculum resource called my view. They have been very collaborative and inclusive in the
9:47
process to make sure everyone's voice is heard in the entire presentation.
9:53
um of the implementation of my view. You will enjoy this innovative presentation
9:58
that these teachers are very passionate about tonight. All right. And every
10:04
teacher will introduce themselves as they come up and do their part of the presentation.
10:14
This is next.
10:22
Yeah. All right. Good evening. My name is Emily Acres. I'm kindergarten at
10:27
Heritage Elementary. And I am Sydney Wesling and I'm also kindergarten at Heritage. And we're just going to talk
10:34
briefly on the writing portion of the My View Literacy program. Uh the writing
10:41
program gives students the tools to express their ideas uh using proper
10:46
writing mechanics in language and conventions such as nouns, pronouns,
10:51
etc. And then those students apply foundational writing skills following the writing process and that is taught
10:57
explicitly um through pre-write, draft, revise and edit and publishing. Um and
11:03
with these foundational skills, we still follow the gradual release of responsibility
11:09
where we'll after teaching the the skill, we will stand up and we will
11:14
present it as it's we work together. I'm sorry, we
11:19
model first and then we work together to practice the skill and then we send the students off independently.
11:26
And I am just going to talk a little bit more about the five-day writing process that we do each week in our units. Um on
11:34
day one, we do some sort of brainstorming. So students will generate
11:39
ideas through discussions, drawings, and shared planning. We model how writers
11:44
think before they write and help students choose a topic and plan what plan out what they want to say. On day
11:50
two, we take all those ideas that they came up with and we organize them. They began structuring their thoughts,
11:56
deciding what comes first and what comes next. We use different graphic organizers, shared writing, and sentence
12:02
stems to help them build logical order, usually through a list of some sort. Um,
12:07
on day three is their rough draft. Students will write down the ideas using
12:12
phonetic spelling in complete sentences. The focus is on getting their ideas on paper, not necessarily perfection. This
12:20
is where we we see students applying their phonics knowledge and building writing stamina. On day four, we revise
12:27
and edit. Students learn that strong writers improve their work. Revising might mean adding detail or making
12:32
sentences clearer. Editing focuses on mechanics such as capital letters,
12:38
spacing, and punctuation that we are focusing on in kindergarten. And then lastly, day five, students present and
12:45
share their writing. Students publish their work in a neat final copy and share with classmates. This builds pride
12:51
in speaking, pride, speaking skills, and confidence. It also reinforces that their ideas matter and for them to take
12:57
risks with their academics. Yeah, they've come a long ways to
13:03
kindergarten from to the end of the year. So, I included some pictures. Um, I for
13:09
the first one is a fruits anchor chart. So, the my view topic for writing was fruits. So they came up with some of
13:17
ideas of fruits that they eat every day and I put those on an anchor chart. Um
13:22
below that we have a picture of two students sharing their writing with one another. They do share their writing in
13:28
many different ways whether it's just partners will come put them under the Elmo um so then everyone can see them or
13:35
it just might be share with your table group. And then I also included two different work samples. The top one is
13:42
from I want to say December when we were talking about fruits and the kid did a
13:48
great job doing writing with the sentence stems and then providing his own phonetic a phonmic awareness skills
13:55
to finish the sentence. And then the one on the bottom is one from last week
14:01
where we are currently working on personal narratives of telling a story with first, next, and last. And so
14:06
they've come a really long way with those. So yeah.
14:20
Oh, it's already on there. Okay, perfect. Hi, I'm Madison Lanza. I'm a first grade teacher at Heritage. Hi, I'm
14:26
Mane Kimmery, also a first grade teacher at Heritage. And I'm Angela Glady, a first grade teacher at Heritage.
14:32
Um, so what we are going to talk to you about is a little bit about data and assessments. So, um, we're going to tell
14:38
you the assessments that we use throughout a unit in my view and then kind of how we keep track and store that data to help us with report cards and
14:44
all of that kind of stuff. So, um, there are three main assessments that we use throughout a unit um, to track student
14:51
growth. So, those are exit tickets, weekly progress checks, and unit tests. So, those exit tickets are just daily
14:59
quick check-ins. Um, they go along directly with the lesson content. Um, and we keep it pretty simple. we just
15:06
give them a sticky note and we have the question up on the board and they just write A B C or one, two, three or one of
15:12
each if there's two questions. Um, and so it's just a quick way for us to see who got it and who might need a little
15:18
bit of reteing. And then the weekly progress checks are given after a week
15:23
of lessons and they just address a specific weekly question. Each week has a question throughout a unit. Um, and
15:29
then the content from that week, we have our students complete these using Seessaw. So the apps you saw they have
15:35
iPads. Um it has a story on there they read and then they answer the questions that go along with whatever text is on
15:41
there. Um so this is it's a great way to give summitive data but also kind of as we go through the unit as well. And then
15:48
our unit tests are the kind of comprehensive summitive assessment of the whole unit obviously. Um these cover
15:54
all the standards, unit goals, unit questions um and the big essential
15:59
question of the entire unit. And we have students complete these on their iPads through Google Classroom and it d goes
16:06
directly to the SAVIS uh website. So it's all just directly through there.
16:13
Um and then we use that information to gather data driven um um information to
16:19
put onto a sheets. And then you can see right there that there's an example from our classes of where we document all of
16:26
that. Under that we put it into categories based on the standards and then under the standards we put it into
16:33
um what assessment we do and then it is also colorc coded based on each unit
16:38
that we are teaching. So we're able to sift through that information to transition it into our report cards.
16:47
And then all of this data um we use for our standardsbased report cards um
16:53
because we measure growth against um year-end data instead of um how we used
17:01
to do it. It's um standardsbased. Um it doesn't reset after each quarter. Um we
17:08
look at all of their progress throughout the entire year. Um, this ensures that
17:14
every report card mark is evidence-based, consistent across our team, and accurately reflects each
17:19
student's progress towards mastery.
17:31
Hi, I'm Mindy Grimman, second grade South Prairie. And I'm Molly Sorenson, second grade South Prairie. Um, and we are here to
17:38
talk to you about the weekly routine. So my view um everything is in a fiveday
17:45
rotation as we go through the weeks and um all of our trainings we've had they've talked about the importance of
17:50
every day and how it builds through. Um it's like a puzzle. So all the pieces
17:55
work together to help the kids understand the theme or objective of the week. Um so day one we just introduce
18:03
the theme what uh the genre that we're going to be talking about. So for instance this week we are introducing
18:09
biographies. We're starting today. They just learned what is a biography. We talked a lot about different um kinds or
18:16
different biographies that we've seen. Um and then on the second day of the week, then we go into introducing the
18:23
story that goes along with the biography. And day three is when we we call it our
18:29
underlining day. Students love to get out their pencils and underline in their colored books um that we had printed um
18:36
or gave give given to us. Um, and so they dig in and they learn about the
18:43
reading and they find out what the purpose is behind the story that they're reading. Um, day four is our highlight
18:50
day. Another really exciting day. They get really excited to get out their highlighters and they get to um, dig in
18:56
and find out what is the next purpose. So day four is a lot more digging deeper
19:01
and you have to infer a lot more. um it will ask you to go back into the text and find something and then it'll ask
19:08
them what do you think that that means and digging into the vocabulary. Um and
19:13
they really enjoy finding their answers. We did after we had the My View consultant come out um change up the way
19:20
we were doing this a little bit and now the students are um really good at working in small groups. We started at
19:27
the beginning of the year working together as a class and figuring out how to do this five-day routine together.
19:32
And now the students are confident enough that we can break them up into small groups and give them like a little note card with the question of the day
19:39
or for a couple pages and they'll go and find that answer and underline or highlight and show that they can do that
19:45
in small groups and then we come back together and um they share with the class and we all see if we agree with
19:50
what they found in their text. um seeing their confidence grow with that has been a lot of fun and it's taken a little bit
19:57
of the work off of the teachers guiding each thing and it's put a lot more in the students hands and the confidence in us too because we
20:04
weren't sure at first since it's so new to us if they could do that but then when we tried it it was impressive to
20:09
see they proved to us they could do it. Yeah. Um and then day five is reflect and share. This is a fun day because
20:16
it's putting everything together that they've learned from the genre and the theme and then digging into stories and
20:22
um talking about the vocabulary and what they've learned from that week and um
20:27
they get to talk to each other about what they have um learned and we also
20:33
talk about respect um disagreeing respectfully and because you don't always have to agree with one another
20:38
but how can you respectfully disagree? We um do this through conversation a lot. We've just started adding in a
20:45
little bit of reflecting through writing. So, it's been fun to see them grow throughout the year with this
20:50
program. Yeah. Thanks.
20:58
Um, hi, my name is Nicole Landwear and I teach third grade at Dallas Center Elementary. Um, third and fourth grade
21:05
teach word study with My View. In my view, word study focuses focuses on
21:10
vocabulary, spelling patterns, and prefixes and suffixes, all of which are directly connected to the text students
21:17
are reading each week. This helps students learn words in context rather than just in isolation. Uh because of
21:24
this, students are more confident breaking apart unfamiliar words and they're using stronger vocabulary in
21:29
their writing and in their conversations and they're better prepared for assessments like ISASP. Um on the screen
21:35
you can see some examples of resources that we use to practice the different word study skills. So overall word study
21:44
um the word study component of my view supports deeper comprehension and helps build stronger readers and writers.
21:56
Hi my name is Madison Grove. I'm a fourth grade teacher at Northridge Elementary. Hi Sarah Henriks, fourth
22:02
grade teacher at Northridge. we are going to talk about um the project week.
22:07
So my view is based on a six week cycle. Um you do five weeks of what they talked
22:14
about. Um and then the sixth week is a project week. So you take all of the
22:19
learning that you did for those five weeks and you create a different projects based on the learning that they
22:26
did. And then the seventh week of my view is um their assessment week, unit assessment week. So each unit is about
22:34
seven weeks long and there's five units total.
22:39
Um so these are just some examples of different projects that we've done so far this school year. Um the projects go
22:46
along with the unit theme. So, for example, our first unit um was all about
22:52
like Earth's features and um we got to kind of do a well, our six week project
22:59
was we got to research a state and create a brochure about it. So, they actually um get to apply their learning
23:06
and take ownership and have somewhat of a choice in what their project is um with some research guidelines. So like
23:13
they use some fun sites like Pebble Go or KD um some of those resources to do
23:19
the research. Um and then they created a um brochure about why you should go
23:25
visit a certain state um and got to have like claim and evidence and like practice those like reading
23:32
comprehension skills as they do their research um to apply their learning. And
23:37
then the second um project we did was an endangered animals unit. And so they got
23:44
to research a animal that's going endangered and then create a poster as to like how you can help save that
23:50
animal. um they get really excited about these projects because they have a choice in them and like get to um kind
23:58
of convince and present their ideas to um their classmates at the end of the week and then we display their projects
24:06
and so they get super excited about them. They really enjoy the project week. And then the last one um the one
24:12
on the right that was for our diversity unit for unit three. they created a stamp um about a famous African-American
24:20
and they got to choose the person that they wanted um and believe that deserved their own stamp and then write again
24:27
like evidence and reasoning based on their research to come up with their ideas. Um
24:33
yeah, we try and mix it in with social studies too and whatever they're learning in with social studies because
24:38
we have limited time to get everything in. So, we try and combine a little bit of both, but project week is one of
24:45
their favorite weeks. And then we're also reviewing like all the other five week skills for word
24:52
study um before they take their unit test for week seven. So, it's a good combination of like doing something fun
24:58
with like reviewing all the skills um from the first five weeks, too, so that they're prepared for their test.
25:06
So, I'm going to kind of wrap it all up together for you. Um, so we adopted my
25:11
view, we started with third and fourth grade two years ago and this is K one and two, their first year with doing
25:17
this. That's a big adoption of literacy curriculum is huge. We really appre
25:22
appreciate the leadership that Shana Olsen provided in that adoption and continues to provide. Um, she's uh
25:30
helped to give us great professional development for that. Uh, Tyra as the
25:35
curriculum facilitator has been huge. Um, we had a great literacy lead team
25:41
that all came together and met during those flex days to decide what to adopt. I mean, that's how we use all those
25:47
days. The Wednesdays we have some of the professional development. Uh, we had a day just recently the second grade
25:53
teachers were talking about the curriculum reps coming. Well, they come to a school and they teach a lesson and
25:59
you get to watch them teach that lesson and then you ask some questions. So like I said, still some quality professional
26:04
development around that because it is a huge change to the instruction that we've been giving given. Um and then our
26:12
instructional coaches are huge in this implementation too. So all those people
26:18
helped to make it very successful. the teachers have been very open and what I hope you saw is it doesn't matter what
26:25
school you're at and even those it's very consistent the grades from grade to
26:30
grade when they were talking about um first grade I was looking at your data I sat in a fourth grade team meeting today
26:37
and they were looking at that just like that with the standards so that consistency piece is huge and um what I
26:45
loved is these guys never met together to prepare this. They were like, as
26:50
elementary principles, we were we like to model our collaboration and get our
26:56
teachers to do the same. And so it was like, what do we all have in common? Well, my view was a thing. And I was
27:03
just very impressed at how through email that this team was able to put together
27:08
a presentation. They're like, okay, this is how we can do it. And I just think it shows a lot about the level of
27:14
collaboration amongst our teaching staff because it doesn't matter what building you're in, you're going to get a similar
27:20
experience and they are collaborating and working together. And I hope that you saw that through our presentation.
27:26
Do you guys have any questions? Not just for me or any of the the team.
27:36
I can say from my observations um and I'm sure the other principles could as
27:41
well when I have been into a classroom I see a deeper level of conversations.
27:46
They're really having conversations about the text and anytime I go um they they are a little bit nervous about me
27:53
coming and observing something so new. But it is amazing uh because they the
27:59
students are they're really looking at text different than they ever have. And so I believe this has been a huge
28:04
adoption and like I said it's we appreciate Shannon leading the way for us. Maybe just pass on a few thank yous here
28:12
but certainly to the the principles for coming and presenting to us but the teachers especially for taking some time
28:18
out of your evening to come and uh present to us. It's always great to hear from you. you're the ones that are
28:23
working with the curriculum firsthand and um we we always love seeing the principles but it's extra special when
28:29
you guys come and give us a little time too but we love for them to come also. Yeah.
28:35
And then Deb and Diane I just wanted to ju just on behalf of the board thank you both very much for your many years of
28:42
service to our students and our families and our staff. Um, we just uh thank you
28:47
doesn't go uh probably far enough, but we are truly appreciative of all the contributions you've made to DCG. So,
28:54
thank you. Teachers, I've got a few bullets coming
28:59
up. If a couple want to stick around, you guys could
29:05
share. No. Thanks, G. Appreciate you.
29:10
All right. So, uh, Greg is out this evening. So, um, he put, uh, some
29:17
additional information kind of in the tabby tab review and the agenda. So,
29:22
just thought I would see if the board have any questions, uh, on the assistant superintendent
29:29
uh, materials.
29:34
Yeah. All right. Well, uh, All right, Dr. Bloom.
29:40
All right. Well, thank you much. Uh again, if you got any questions uh for Greg, don't hesitate to reach out or me,
29:46
but no one can be Greg, so I'm glad you didn't make me try to like read that. No, no, I don't think that's
29:53
appropriate. Uh six building permits this month. Uh six in Grimes. We didn't have any in
29:59
Dallas Center. Um so we're, you know, kind of right on track as where we were
30:05
last year. So hopefully that keeps moving and shaking. We were down seven students this past month. So you can say
30:11
we had a couple of move in and move outs, but also that uh when we have those students graduate early, we
30:17
ultimately don't count them as a seat anymore. So can I ask a question about
30:23
that? So when a student graduates early, is um so so is the the the funding reduced by
30:32
proportionate share based on their graduation date or do we still receive full funding for the year? Okay.
30:42
Okay. On the October one. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. Got it. Thanks.
30:48
Yeah. Great question. So, yeah, that's just a reduction in seats, not necessarily loss of kids. So,
30:56
um Okay, so let's talk about just a couple of quick updates on facilities,
31:02
mainly with the bond. Um this is moving and shaking, which is exciting. the
31:08
um later in the month of March, we will need a meeting or two uh to maybe com,
31:13
you know, um combined with what we've got now because we're going to do some schematic design and some bidding
31:20
approvals, especially with the playgrounds and DC Elementary and
31:26
Northridge with the the safety security kind of front entrance since those items
31:32
are still on track to be completed this summer and be ready to go uh for the start of school. The bidding process is
31:40
uh coming up. So, we'll have kind of a bidding meeting. That's where contractors that may be interested are
31:45
going to learn more about the details of the projects. Then ultimately, they will be given a bid date where they will need
31:51
to to bid on this project. So, you will have uh a role in kind of, you know, approving those bids and ultimately
31:57
accepting the final bids. But that that will get uh kind of hot and heavy the
32:02
the month of March so we can get it bidded, contracted out and so that group
32:08
is ready to go uh kind of the the start of school. So our folks in Dallas Center
32:13
and Elementary Northridge know their time in the building this summer will be very very limited if at all to let them
32:20
just get in there and knock it all out. Um but no, the exciting stuff is coming.
32:25
We saw last week, I think it was, um, the very very first of many schematic
32:32
design rough draft of the high school. So, this is taking all of the input and
32:38
just putting in kind of 3D design a little bit of some of the changes that
32:44
could come. So, again, it's very high level. There's not a lot of specifics yet, but that will now follow a bunch of
32:51
meetings with stakeholders in those different spaces to say, here's the first kind of run at it. What did we
32:57
miss? What needs to be added? What needs to be taken out? So, it's just kind of cool cuz like you guys, all we've seen
33:04
is kind of the colored boxes. this brought some of those boxes to life and
33:09
say, "Hey, you can actually raise the roof here and get some natural light in here and this is what a science
33:14
classroom could look like, a commons area." Just the first kind of dive into
33:20
a little more detail. So, that will start to keep coming um along that won't
33:25
be a bidded project for many many more months down the road. So, the the other
33:31
ones will go quickly. The high school is still going to take quite a bit of time. So, any questions on facilities?
33:40
Okay. So, let's talk legislative updates. Um, I've got a couple and I'm going to have AJ, I'm going to have you
33:47
maybe jump to the microphone too with yours if you want to pass those out while I talk. We just want to give you a
33:52
little bit of update of kind of the DCG communication
33:57
uh part of legislative updates. But some of the big ticket items I want to share with funnel week ended last week, right?
34:03
So, if it didn't make it out of funnel, there's a really, really hard chance for it to um get through. There's still some
34:09
funky ways, but for the most part, those are dead. Um, hearing from our ISB and
34:15
SAI folks, um, they've been down there for years and years. They said this is
34:20
by far the most amount of bills ever put through under education. So, and they're
34:27
all over the place in terms of topic and will they pass. So, there's kind of a
34:32
lot to watch and a little substance right now. Um, starting with dollars and
34:39
cents. Those that uh may not be aware. Nice one. Thank you. Um,
34:47
House was at 2.25, Senate was 1.75 when it comes to SSA. Governor's at two.
34:54
Looks like they had the initial back and forth and will probably settle around two. that's still have to be debated and
35:00
approved, but I think there's a very good chance that we are right around the 2% SSA mark. Um,
35:08
I think any of these final decisions, they know that the negative talking point is going to be the property tax
35:15
impact that budget guarantee has. So, they're going to pay for that on their own. um which which is nice, but I also
35:24
selfishly think it's a way for them to not be kind of ripped to pieces by schools. Um but that's in there. And
35:31
then um most likely the $14 million, which is a good thing for our support
35:38
staff to fund that again so we can take care of of those folks. But Michelle's
35:43
going to go much more in depth with this next Monday, but 2.25% 25% SSA or lower
35:49
puts DCG in budget guarantee. So we now all of our models are just assuming we're in budget guarantee. It's just a
35:56
matter of how much money we'll get. So um this is a
36:02
I mean to be blunt this has a negative impact on things when they are not um
36:07
keeping up with lots of things. uh inflation as we mentioned I think last
36:13
month um this will be significantly less than they spent last year on public
36:18
education even though it's in the same 2% ballpark. So it's very frustrating
36:24
but we will figure it out and take care of our people. There has been really no movement on property taxes. So I haven't
36:31
heard much to share with you on could that impact a management fund, could it impact PPE, um those types of things.
36:38
So, we'll just keep following that. And then, gang, they're all over the place from cameras in special ed classrooms to
36:46
to countdates to behavior of students to charter schools to I mean, it's kind of
36:53
name the education topic. There's a bill that has made it through the funnel to
36:58
at least be debated. So, we'll keep being advocates. I have a meeting next
37:04
Friday um with Representative Nordman. Carter Nordman does not actually
37:10
represent DCG, but I reach out to those around. Appreciate him making time for me to just talk shop. So, uh we'll do
37:18
that and and keep advocating for lots of things. But one of the big items that is
37:25
going to be out there is tax rate, property taxes, school funding. How does
37:32
it all jive together? It's very confusing. Um, and it's probably easy for our constituents to get potentially
37:40
muddied with the complexity and some of the numbers. So, um, AJ, Michelle and I
37:46
and team have been working hard about how can we make this a little more succinct, but also DCG
37:55
um, taking a step forward in the being a little more vocal um, with some of this
38:00
work. We do, I think, a very good job behind the scenes, but what are some of the maybe in front of the scenes items
38:07
that that we can think of? So AJ, if I can call you to the mic, you were the the brilliance about putting this
38:13
together. So do you want to maybe just kind of walk through what they're looking at on this sheet and then I
38:19
Michelle and I can help fill in any numbers or questions. So you got it. So uh what's in front of you
38:24
are three different documents. All look the same. Two of them are um from recessed property values of two
38:30
different values of Grimes homes and then one in Dallas Center. And the goal of this was to essentially show down to
38:36
the penny where your property tax value goes um in categories and then when we
38:43
take it over into when it comes the money that comes to Dallas Center Grimes where it goes down to the penny in the
38:48
four categories um for the district. And so we were going to bring this to you tonight as our first step and then we're going to post it online and on social
38:55
media um tomorrow as part of our um advocacy work about showing where your
39:00
property tax values are to the penny. um you know in a range uh in our two communities. So that's step one. And
39:07
then also we'll be going online on a brand new legislative advocacy website. It's on me for not having it done
39:13
earlier. Um, but I should have had it done, but it's also a way to contact your legislators kind of also with this
39:18
document about where property tax value goes. Um, and how it supports kids. And then really how many different areas the
39:24
property tax value when it comes to DCG, where it goes and how many different places it impacts from structures to the
39:30
general fund to ple u to management. All of that will be included in that document down to down to the penny. Um,
39:37
and so that's ready to go. you you are the first crew to see that and then we will be more proactive with it starting
39:44
tomorrow. AJ, this is amazing. Thank you. I hopefully it helps and I mean
39:50
Michelle's was a huge help to it. So I think I do think it will um be very and
39:57
down, you know, pretty a graphic that's easy to read for people to see and um
40:02
kind of take their information from. I think it's important to note that it's a moment in time. its current year
40:08
budget. So, it's not looking at fiscal year 27. We want to make sure that the public understands that this is a
40:14
snapshot of the current budget and where funds are going in the current budget.
40:20
And and property tax values from assessed 2425 homes as well.
40:25
Y yeah, it's great. Y we uh we thought it was important again, we've AJ and Michelle and I have been
40:31
working closely together and what will be on our website is a little advocacy page. So now you can our families can go
40:37
there and contact people and kind of see um some of our values and and so on. But
40:42
also we'll start to get this out because I I think it's important another reminder for our families. For the most
40:50
part DCG and all public schools have two levers. What they get in SSA and
40:56
property tax. the higher the SSA from the state by typically the the lower the property
41:03
that they are friends and work together. So, what we thought was important because yes, DCG has higher property
41:09
taxes than than several is to the penny again pretty generally speaking, but to
41:16
the penny where your dollars are going for your property taxes, right? 80% of
41:22
your property taxes are not going to the school district. And when the money does go to the school district, we are very
41:28
fiscally responsible with them. And those would be the breakdowns of what those dollars and cents are going to.
41:34
So, um, there is a little bit of rhetoric out there right now, um, regarding SSA and
41:41
this idea that, well, since Iowa has a declining birth rate and declining population,
41:48
2% is actually an increase in student funding. And so, if there is anyone out
41:54
there, there are several legislators that are currently reporting this message. And so we want to be based in
42:02
fact and we're not trying to insult anyone, right? Um good policy happens
42:08
when people from different sides come together and work together and this is a really important time for us in our
42:13
school district. Um so if people are hearing that kind of argument, how how
42:19
would you encourage them to respond to their legislators because it is fun it
42:25
has been the first funnel. legislators are hearing from constituents in particular since they've come so quickly
42:31
to what seems to be an agreement. How would you encourage stakeholders to respond to that that 2% isn't sufficient
42:39
funding? Yeah, thank you, Nancy. And and I've I keep telling our team this and I keep trying to tell families that I talk to
42:47
be perfectly honest, they're tired of superintendent and school board members. They they've heard from us every week,
42:54
every month. This is going to be a familydriven impact. I am pretty
43:00
confident in all the bills that made it out to funnel the great majority of these they believe Republican or
43:06
Democrat believe that families and kids are involved. And I so I think the more
43:13
those folks are reaching out the better. I think we continue to tell our story of how much
43:21
what we ask for, whether it's dollars and cents or bills or legislation, is affecting kids, right? These dollars and
43:28
cents impact the lives of our students. So, I think Nancy, to your great question, the advocacy page will be very
43:35
easy for them to find their legislator. So, they can just go right to dcgschools.com to find their legislator.
43:41
But if anyone is ever curious how does this proposed bill impact DCG,
43:47
I'd be happy to do my best to talk with them, walk through it so they feel like there's some connection to DCG when they
43:55
reach out to their legislature one way or the other. I'd be I'd be happy to help give as many facts as I can on the
44:02
impact to a specific bill directly to our kids.
44:07
Thank you, Dr. Bloom. And just to clarify, what you're saying is 2% is not
44:12
sufficient to cover the cost of inflation. It's not an increase in student funding.
44:17
Correct. And so, yep, reaching out is never mattered more. Is absolutely matters the most. There
44:24
will be roughly at least half of the schools in budget guarantee. Um, to
44:30
those watching that may not be aware, essentially that means we're we're gonna have to try to do the same amount or
44:36
more with less. Again, there That's over half of the schools. That's personally I
44:41
I find that a little embarrassing as a state. Um we have now started to hear in some of my superintendent meetings that
44:48
there are schools because of the funding that are actually growing some of their
44:54
student population and still having to make cuts because of what the dollars and cents actually equal to. When it
45:01
comes to 2% is probably not the rate of operational cost. 2% is probably not the
45:08
rate of insurance premiums 2%. So like there are even schools that are gaining students that this will not
45:16
bring enough money to. So you appreciate all the help our families
45:21
can give because you're taking care of DCG and public schools across the state. So
45:28
yeah. Go ahead. R maybe just a quick question. Um appreciate the the rundown on the the
45:33
property tax stuff. Last year, there was a bill that was going to affect um kind
45:39
of the the way that uh school districts raised bond revenue.
45:44
Did that is that still in the mix? Is that something that I think we were a little concerned based that based on
45:52
last year's language that it could come back up and potentially have an effect on our trajectory here.
45:58
I don't know if it's still out there in the property tax bill or not. There's a ton of school bills out there.
46:04
I've not heard I've not heard a peep about that by itself. So, unless it starts getting worked in somewhere like
46:11
properly, I've not heard anything about it by itself. Yeah, it might be good to know if maybe
46:17
Tim would know or or someone. But if if we know that if we can get that out on the advoc advocacy page as well. I
46:23
think, you know, we've we've made some plans based on our ability to raise uh
46:28
bond revenue over the next few years. If that's impacted, then we're going to have to
46:34
um think about what that means and and how that impacts us, which um would be ideal not to have to do.
46:41
And I hate to keep talking dollars and cents only, but to Michelle and I um
46:46
feel the same way, what they are talking about is ple and save dollars. They are talking about maximizing some of those
46:52
percentages. And again, you start messing with peple and save
46:58
very intentionally buckets of money over here to take care of things so we don't
47:03
take anything away from humans, right? We want to buy buses. We want to fix
47:08
roofs. We want to get our one-on-one technology over here. If they start cutting that, we will one day have
47:16
conversations about do we hire a teacher or pay for a bus, right? Not that those numbers are even sadly equal, but right
47:24
now we don't have to have human conversations mixed with building things. And so that is a real item being
47:34
discussed right now. Pebble and save dollars. So that would be an advocacy piece you could do today. Michelle,
47:40
anything else or good? Nope.
47:46
All right. I just want to give a special shout out to our career and technical education staff. It is CTE month this
47:52
month. So, just wanted to highlight all the great work that they do. Um, you
47:57
know, this is a field collectively that I think is starting to skyrocket. Um,
48:03
very important that our kids are doing the core uh classes. Obviously, I think
48:08
we would argue just as important that our kids are starting to figure out what else they want to do. Do they want to be
48:14
welders? Do they want to be in computer science, right? Do they want to do all of the many things that we offer at DCG?
48:21
CT is a big part of the high school bond referendum as well. Um, which is exciting. But these folks all across our
48:29
district do a lot of neat and incredible things for our kids to really give them opportunities, get their innovation to
48:36
kind of grow. So, super proud of this group. Uh, specific shout out because it just happened a couple a week or two
48:42
ago. um DECA right is our business organization um that competes across the
48:48
state and we had I want to say 17 um 15 top seven finalists and four state
48:55
champions in DECA. Um so that's Mr. Nelson u Mr. Larson uh do that at the
49:02
high school and every year that thing has just kind of taken off. Um, so awesome work out of the Deca crew and
49:09
kids, but again a shout out publicly to our career and technical education staff that again are are doing a lot of things
49:16
that our kids are interested in and and grateful that they spend their time teaching kids when they could take those
49:22
talents and uh put them in the private sector very easily. So glad they're with us. So,
49:28
and my last thing is just last couple weeks ago, so this is last month, we got
49:34
to run around and and celebrate uh the creators, which is which is a highlight.
49:39
There's the names of the folks that we celebrated um a couple weeks ago and we
49:44
are on the move this coming Friday. So, you'll see some social media posts with
49:49
the group that uh we're going to acknowledge next. I think we're probably mid20s for this month. So, a lot of fun,
49:57
but grateful for all of our people and you got to see a wonderful representation of our staff tonight as
50:04
well. So, with that, I'll take any questions. Otherwise, I think I'm good.
50:11
Okay. Thank you, Miss Wman. Taking a look at the revenue and
50:16
expenditure summary for uh the week ending February 19th, 2026, you'll see
50:23
we're at 52 or almost 53% of uh our appropriated expenditures.
50:29
That puts us about a percent behind where we were last year. A lot of that
50:35
has to do with the timing of payments for special education tuition. So I
50:40
think really we're right in line with where we have been in the previous four years. And then taking a look at
50:46
revenue, you will notice that some of our revenue for federal funds has started to trickle in. And uh note that
50:54
our revenue is at 53.01% of uh what our appropriations were for
51:01
the year for that. taking a look at the public budget comparison report and comparing what you
51:08
certified to the taxpayers in the newspaper last year to uh what is really
51:13
occurring. You'll notice that we are at 45% in the instruction area, 30% in
51:19
non-instruction area, 16% in other expenditures, which includes bond
51:24
expenditures, and then the only one that's kind of sticking out like a sore thumb is that support services area at
51:31
about 51%. I will be proposing an amendment and I will bring that to you to discuss uh
51:37
next Monday night when we talk about the certified budget. We will talk about the process to amend the fiscal year 26
51:45
budget and actions that the board will take in order to do that. Remember, it's important for us to amend our budget
51:51
prior to overexpending it and we are well within the limit for that. Need to have it done before the last day in May.
51:59
So, uh, we'll take action in March and April, uh, for the amendment. Do you
52:06
have any questions as far as those two things go? Okay, moving along. Um, I'm going to
52:14
just point out to you once again, this is our certified budget timeline. You'll notice that our next action is Monday,
52:22
March 2, where you will get um the bucket presentation uh full of property
52:29
tax assessments. So,
52:39
thanks. Thanks for catching up.
52:47
Subsequent to that, on on uh Monday, I will send out public hearing a
52:52
information to the county auditor who will then in turn send it out to the taxpayers uh to get in their mailboxes
52:59
and say, "What's this? I'm going to call this lady and talk to her." So, I welcome those calls and happy to talk to
53:05
people about uh what our proposed property tax will be. Um that h county
53:11
auditors send that out about the 20th of March. uh then we will take action at the March board meeting and we will take
53:18
action at the April board meeting certifying our budget well in advance of
53:23
the deadline of April 30th. So that's the walkthrough for that. Uh then as far
53:30
as uh the next item this is uh budget guarantee impacting our fiscal 27
53:37
budget. As you are aware we are uh uh from count to count down 41.6 six
53:43
students in certified enrollment. Those are resident student count that we're looking at there. And if SSA were to
53:51
come in at the 1.75% SSA uh that the Senate has proposed,
53:57
budget guarantee uh would be $130,932.
54:02
If it comes in at 2%, it will be a little bit less. It'll be $62,838.
54:09
I think it's important for the board to understand that wherever they move SSA up to two and a 2.25%
54:17
we're still going to get that 1% additional 101% of last year's budget.
54:23
Um it we have to be beyond 2.25 SSA to move that needle for DCG at all. So, um,
54:32
the important thing to remember about budget guarantee is the board the state holds us harmless for that one year, uh,
54:40
to help cushion the fall in budgets. Uh, and it's entirely on property tax. So, that will go entirely into the property
54:47
tax calculation that we'll talk about next Monday night. You will consider a motion to approve uh, budget guarantee
54:56
in tonight's new business. without that then we can't participate in that program.
55:02
Um, looking forward uh to the next bond sale. It feels like we just took a
55:08
breath and sold 14.7 million in bonds uh as we closed December of 2025 and now we
55:15
are planning for the next bond sale. Um, this timeline was produced by uh Piper
55:21
Sandler and uh you'll notice that uh there's a couple special board meetings
55:27
in there. Uh one is an electronic board meeting following the actual bids that
55:33
take place. Uh we will sell between 44 and $45 million worth of general
55:38
obligation bonds in this sale. and that will leave about 28 million left to
55:44
sell. Uh depending on how those bids come in in the final number, but we're about 28 million in the subsequent
55:50
fiscal year in all likelihood. So, um, if you have questions about that
55:56
timeline, but I just wanted you to realize that process is moving along as we get to the point where we're going to
56:02
start really spending money on the projects that were laid out to the voters when it went uh uh to vote on
56:10
November 4th last year. And uh, finally, oh, that's all I have.
56:17
Congratulations. You're done with me. Question. Can I see you in my office after the meeting? Thank you.
56:23
Sure. Right away. Thank you. Yeah. Any questions for Michelle?
56:31
All right. Um we'll move along then to old business. We've got the second reading of
56:37
uh 2, four, and five and 800 series policies. Looking for a
56:43
motion. Move to approve. Malberg. Second. Dickson. Any discussion?
56:49
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. I oppose same sign. Motion carries. Item

57:07

57:14
motion. Move to approve. Mberg. Second. Fella.
57:20
Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I.
57:25
I. Oppos. Same sign. Motion carries. Um Dr.
57:31
Bloom, any additional information on Brain Health Now agreement? Yeah. So, this is a really neat uh
57:36
partnership. So, it's it's nothing from uh DCG from a dollars and cents perspective. So, we have a um room that
57:45
we are able to staff with existing staff members at Oakview um that allow us to
57:50
kind of have what it's called a brain health room. So, students that
57:56
maybe for mental health or just what's going on, they can go see a staff member. So, it's at times there's a
58:02
special ed teacher in there. Um, times there's a counselor in there that allows us to kind of a dedicated space um for
58:09
students to kind of be able to to take care of some needs and and certainly get some
58:14
school at the same time. So, this is a agreement with Brain Health. They actually like kind of um provide the
58:20
stuff like the physical needs of the space, the furniture, the some of the
58:26
equipment. Um, and like I said, we've already had existing staff willing to kind of pilot this program to see if
58:33
this has some long-term run for us. So, um, it's been about a month or so, no,
58:38
not quite a month or so, a couple weeks we've been able to at least get it ready for at Oakview and it's been been
58:44
successful. So, is this like a sensory room at the
58:49
elementary school? Is this like a a chill out space? Is this for typical
58:55
kids or special ed kids? I'm just kind of curious. Yeah, it's it's yes to all of that. Um
59:01
it's certainly Nancy has much more of a
59:06
classroom learning environment feel cuz like there's there's a special ed teacher housed there every time. I don't
59:13
want to say it's like a it's not like a pull out onetoone type room necessarily,
59:20
but we've got Jeff Kaine who's going to kind of be the guy in charge of there and then he works closely with the two
59:27
counselors on if kids need certain things and when. So, it has some of those items, but it really has more of a
59:35
I'm going to need the next two days to to just kind of
59:40
be here and do my thing because the classroom's not going to work for a variety of reasons. It could be longer
59:45
than that if kids need it. So, it's more of a learning mental health kind of
59:51
space than it is like a I need 15 minutes to pop in and do my thing. It's
59:57
going to have a more of a maybe a touch longer classroom feel if that makes sense. Um,
1:00:04
is this where they would go for like their like if they needed to take an assessment like outside of their normal
1:00:09
classroom, they go in there or probably again longer period of time like I'm coming to school but maybe
1:00:16
doing the eight hour day isn't going to be best for me. So, I'm going to work in here. Um,
1:00:24
what I'll what I'll do is I'll get like Allison Finley, our student services director, been all over this. I'll work with her and and send you guys clearly a
1:00:32
better kind of maybe dayto-day subscription of what I'm than what I'm trying to tell you. So, you have some
1:00:39
more kind of can picture what it looks like every single day. But the brain health piece is if you have a space to
1:00:46
allow kids to come to be able to do this, we give you all of the kind of
1:00:54
physical items you need for them. So, furniture, some sensory materials, those things.
1:01:00
So, but I'll get you a little bit more of a day-to-day rundown. So,
1:01:08
looking for a motion. Move to approve.
1:01:14
Second Sander. Any discussion? All those in favor indicate by saying I.
1:01:20
I. Both same sign. Motion carries. Uh item C, Graduation
1:01:27
Alliance, Inc. Agreement. Uh Dr. Bloom, could you give us just maybe a little bit on this one? Yeah, so you guys have probably heard
1:01:33
us. We use a program called Adventum, right? This is kind of a online
1:01:38
um works great for for some of our kids. Some are still on from COVID, others like at the high school use it for
1:01:43
specific individual classes. So, it it it's meeting a great uh need for our
1:01:49
kids. Graduation Alliance is a company that again this is going to allow us to kind of pilot. Um they are much more of
1:01:57
a longerterm online school program. So we have part of our strategic plan a
1:02:03
desire to have an online kind of maybe bigger than admentum where admentum is
1:02:10
much more of a student driven thing graduation alliance is you are teamed up
1:02:16
with a academic adviser through them. You have much more interaction with with
1:02:22
human beings to be frank um with them. So it gives our kids
1:02:28
some opportunity to be a fully functioning online but have more than just I'm kind of doing it on my own. So
1:02:36
right now we have um two two students that are at the high school that would
1:02:42
like to do this for their various reasons. This keeps them attached to the high school. Um prevents them, you know,
1:02:47
from dropping out or anything like that. Allows them to um still be our student and and work at their own pace. But what
1:02:54
Graduation Alliance does is they they do weekly check-ins with them. They've got an academic adviser. Like I said, they
1:03:01
can talk to real teachers at times. If we like how this goes, probably the next
1:03:07
big step for DCG where where graduation alliance does a lot of neat work is they
1:03:13
actually will go work with you to track down students that are currently in this case
1:03:20
open enrolled to other online schools. So, we've got
1:03:26
anywhere from a dozen to 15 students that are sitting in Dallas Center or in Grimes, but they are open enrolled to
1:03:31
another school district because they want a full-fledged online program, Graduation Alliance. That's their sweet
1:03:38
spot. So if we like this, the vision would be to use them to partner with us
1:03:44
to actually go get our existing kids, bring them back to DCG, give them a DCG
1:03:51
diploma, but still allow them to do the online school on a on a little bit um
1:03:57
deeper lens than what Edenum provides. That's not Edenum's probably specialty. Um so we got two high school kids going
1:04:04
to do this. If we like it, we'd kind of like to maybe look at this summer of can we go get some of our kids back if that
1:04:10
makes sense. Thank you. Looking for a motion. Motion to approve quant.
1:04:17
Second. Second. Any discussion? A couple questions. Y um do we have like a specific number of
1:04:25
seats with graduation alliance like we do with Edmonton or is it Great question. It's 100% on the
1:04:32
individual kids. You don't you can add two, you can add however many. So we just have the two and we are build by
1:04:40
month. It will never exceed what we would get in state funding ever. So
1:04:46
you're build by month. So if a kid's doing what they're supposed to, which we hope with their help, there's a bill
1:04:52
each month. If a kid does not hold up their end of the bargain, for example, with Adventum, we just kind of pay for
1:04:59
it. Now, hey, Meg didn't do what she was supposed to this month. Sorry, that's
1:05:04
that's such a impossible hypothetical that I I came with Meg that we actually
1:05:10
are not charged at month because our student didn't do what they were supposed to and and gradu graduation
1:05:16
lines would tell you. So, then we didn't do what we were supposed to. So, you're not charged just by having it. You're
1:05:21
charged based on student progress. Okay. And then would this replace Ednong
1:05:26
or Pro? Great question. Probably not. We think there's admentum still for our
1:05:31
kids that are used to it. We want to keep, but also it's a much better in and
1:05:37
out. We need a class or two. Graduation alliance is would be much more of a
1:05:43
you're doing DCG schooling this way if we ever move forward long term. Momentum
1:05:48
has a little bit more I need one or two classes as much as we use it for kind of the
1:05:55
bigger um bigger picture of an online school.
1:06:00
Graduation alliance would fit more of an online school vision than it meant would.
1:06:06
And right now you said that you have two students that are fully on board.
1:06:11
Would like to get started. Yes. Okay. Yep.
1:06:16
Any other questions? So with the cost increase if we get more state funding, so if that goes up to
1:06:23
8,000, whatever it is, does that cost change? Yeah, they take like up I think it's somewhere close to up to up to 90% of
1:06:30
state funding if a kid like essentially was super successful August 23rd through the end. So yeah,
1:06:37
it's on page four. Yeah, is the breakdown on there for Okay, I couldn't. It looks like 85%'s the ceiling. So They
1:06:44
do it on a day basis. So they take the district cost per pupil divided by the days in session and then that's
1:06:52
multiplied by 85%. So y
1:06:57
we'd have like a 15% clawback on that or something. Yeah, I believe DCG would be number two in
1:07:05
Iowa using graduation alliance. So along with Ankenany uses them quite a bit. So
1:07:11
I have a quick question. would they start in high school on that or like what grade could they potentially start
1:07:17
into that program? Yeah, that's a great question. We use Adventum kind of across the board. Um I
1:07:22
think we could use graduation alliance for any of it. There's their specialty
1:07:29
is at the high school level, but when we've met with them, they are talking about
1:07:35
we would like one day to be able to work with districts and go all the way down as far as they needed us. So awesome.
1:07:40
Yep. Any other questions or any other discussion

1:10:25

1:10:31
uh item I consider contract for DCG district data analyst.
1:10:38
Uh looking for a motion. Move to approve. Dickinson second quant.
1:10:44
Any discussion. I just am kind of curious. Um I know
1:10:49
you've given us some information in the past regarding the school. This feels kind of like a liaison somewhere between
1:10:56
admin and maybe um the instructional coaches or someplace there in the
1:11:02
middle. I'm just curious about how because we saw such great datadriven
1:11:07
presentations that were made. How will this role complement some of the things that our teachers are doing that will
1:11:13
really have a great impact on our students? Yeah, great question. So the the vision Nancy is so what Deetta's been doing
1:11:19
with Infinite Campus Austin's daytoday will be to take care of that, right? To just that's that's got to be step one.
1:11:26
Um and then what we're excited about is whether it's some district responsibilities that he will oversee.
1:11:33
Um the goal would be that group of teachers when they need someone to help
1:11:39
crunch and run the numbers almost with them or for them, they're going to connect with Austin. So right now we ask
1:11:47
all of our people to kind of do a lot of that on their own, which some people have that strength, some don't. Well,
1:11:52
now we're hoping Austin helps make us way more proactive than reactive. And a
1:11:58
PLC could say, "We're interested in looking at the data and doing this." Well, they may not know where that data
1:12:04
is housed. They may not know how to even break it down and share. So he gets to
1:12:10
kind of be this teammate and work alongside them. So they can be the experts teaching. They can then take the
1:12:16
feedback and make their instructional decisions, but with them or in the background, Austin is maybe creating the
1:12:23
ad hoc opportunities for them to be even able to pull that data or what we hope
1:12:30
with his skill set, he's actually going to create significantly more data dashboards for us to be able to use.
1:12:37
Right now, DEA has got to be locked in with just infinite campus. other district people kind of grab the other
1:12:44
stuff and I've I've shared I think candidly for the last three years I feel like we've been reactive in a lot of
1:12:50
ways when it comes to to data this is going to allow us to be proactive so Nancy that'll be a little bit on the
1:12:56
teacher driven to start but Austin when he kind of gets his feet wet with the infinite campus dayto-day then we'll um
1:13:05
be overseeing kind of all our district data whether that's state reporting the
1:13:11
fast testing stuff could oversee ISASP and then be working with instructional coaches, PLC leaders, principles
1:13:19
um on creating kind of whatever their needs are. So then he would maybe help Greg then
1:13:27
with some of the reporting sort numbers. I'm just trying to think like it seems like
1:13:32
um one of the things we've heard when we've had audits done is that a lot of the admin
1:13:38
don't have distributed responsibilities. they take on a lot of and yeah, you know, as we do these board agendas, they
1:13:45
get bigger and bigger every month because we're doing so many good things. And so, one of the things that I am
1:13:52
concerned about is also making sure that the folks that are here doing that great work have the support
1:13:58
that they need to continue to do that work. And so, um, he would then help with the
1:14:05
ISAS stuff, the fast testing. Yeah, I I would say you're you're you
1:14:11
know the the obviously he's not here to answer or I would ask him. Yep. I think you know I think when Greg
1:14:17
has shared with you guys and you've been so gracious to ask at times to him and I like what are what are you needing and I
1:14:22
think this data piece has been missing but it kind of comes a little bit with personnel. I envision yes him tag
1:14:29
teaming with all of the directors and principles. There's going to be certainly some things that come off
1:14:35
people's plates and go directly to Austin. That is why it has an admin
1:14:41
salary attached and he he will be essentially a director of data and and
1:14:47
kind of oversee all that stuff and and partner as needed. So, and then Carrie has created will then
1:14:53
create that job description that correlates with that. Yeah, we've got the job we've got the
1:14:58
data analytics job description already done that you approved in. Yeah, if it needs to change for some more oversight,
1:15:05
great. But right now, that's um that's in a good spot. But yeah, the the goal
1:15:11
and vision is to have Austin really be on the forefront. As an example, Austin even as world assistant principal, he
1:15:17
was kind of the guy that was in charge of all of our chronic absenteeism work. He created the way we counted hours for
1:15:22
every kid that was gone. He created the ad hoc so principles. He created the spreadsheets and the forms, the letters.
1:15:29
That was just a neat example of well now he'll just get to do that as an example
1:15:35
and disseminate that to the people that need that information. Done. You don't have to worry about it's done. Or the
1:15:41
elementary principles could come and say, "Hey, we're really wanting to do X, but not quite sure." They invite Austin
1:15:48
to the room. Well, I could create this. I'll go build that. I'll break it down for you guys this way. So, um, again, I
1:15:55
hope I hope it's a lot more proactive for people. I'm convinced we don't even know what Infinite Campus can do and
1:16:03
what other dashboards and things we can create. Now, with someone doing this kind of on a full-time job, I'm excited
1:16:09
about where this takes us. You know, several years ago, there was really two, you know, probably glaring
1:16:17
staff gaps um that we identified. One of them was a director of HR. We needed
1:16:22
someone focused on HR a couple of cycles ago. The board was able to prioritize the creation of that role. And then the
1:16:30
other one was really a center of excellence for data both static and ad
1:16:35
hoc reporting. And you know, so it's it's good. It needed to be timing. You know, Diet has played that role for um
1:16:44
Infinite Campus for for a number of years and with her retirement, it really was the the right time. So, thanks for
1:16:51
being opportunistic relative to, you know, kind of combining a couple of needs into a single role. So, we could
1:16:58
um, you know, take that under advisement. But, uh, I I think it's good because those, not to say that the
1:17:04
district doesn't have other needs. We certainly do, but those were two kind of big rocks just in terms of just maybe
1:17:10
wholesaley wholesale missing uh, from our staffing structure.
1:17:16
I have a quick question. So we talked about how does infinite campus now currently correct? So we're gonna have Austin do that but
1:17:22
then take on all of this sounds like a really big role. So how is that do we see down the road
1:17:29
something else happening with that role or I mean it seems like a lot for him to take on all she was doing already and
1:17:34
then adding all this data piece which is probably a pretty big it is. Yeah. So I appreciate the question. Yep. and all of our candidates
1:17:41
in in Austin accepting the job kind of knows day one is whatever Infinite Campus is doing for our staff and kids
1:17:48
has to be the focus like Deetta's job we keep telling him. Yep. So if that takes
1:17:54
however many time that's what you're going to do. We believe with his background in infinite campus his
1:17:59
background as a teacher and administrator now he can kind of take that to the next level. So that's why he
1:18:05
is ready to accept kind of the other stuff down the road. I think the vision
1:18:10
would be to then hire a dayto-day infinite campus person so
1:18:17
Austin gets to stay at a higher level more with principles, directors,
1:18:22
teachers, etc. because then someone is running the day-to-day. So right now we get a brand new sub who needs all their
1:18:29
information put into Infinite Campus. That's what Diet is doing that today. Well, Austin has to do that, too. He has
1:18:34
to manually go in and do that down the road. Can we kind of get that person
1:18:40
back in a different capacity? So then our still proactive datadriven mindset is
1:18:48
still an Austin thing, but he's not doing some of the actual entering of data, if
1:18:54
that makes sense. Because I deal with data, so I know how long it takes to to do that kind of stuff. So to do two jobs sounds like a
1:19:01
lot. Yep. Yep. Any other discussion?
