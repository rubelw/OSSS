0:38
Mcnace. All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. I. Post. Same sign.
0:45
Before moving on to new business, I'll read a brief statement regarding tonight's hearing. Since this is the first time the board will hear a
0:51
reconsideration appeal, we've sought the guidance from uh council on how to conduct the hearing. It is important to
0:57
note that the board's focus should be on whether the committee and the superintendent followed the process outlined in policy
1:04
605.03, 605.03R1, and
1:09
605.03 E12 and 3, and whether the superintendent's decision was reasonable
1:16
based on the information reviewed. The board should not substitute its judgment for that of the
1:22
superintendent unless it finds clear error. We'll move along to new business. New
1:28
business is broken into four parts. I'll refer to them as part A1, A2, A3, and
1:36
A4. Item A is the board review of appeal of objection to instructional materials
1:42
decision. Item A1, review the reconsideration committee's
1:47
recommendation and the list of materials considered. Does the board have any questions
1:53
regarding the materials contained within item
1:59
A1? Seeing none, I'll move on to item A2. Review the superintendent's
2:04
determination in relation to the reconsideration committee's findings. Does the board have any
2:10
questions regarding the materials contained within item
2:17
A2? Seeing none, I'll move on to item A3. Miss Olsen and Dr. Bloom will be
2:23
allotted up to 15 minutes to present on the procedural elements of the process as they relate to
2:30
policy. I'll keep track of time. At the end of 14 minutes, I'll raise my hand as a visual cue to begin concluding your
2:37
comments. We'll ask the board to hold any questions until the presenters comments have been
2:44
concluded. You may proceed. Okay. Thank you, Ryan. Appreciate the board being
2:49
here. Um, I I think it's kind of important to start that the board really
2:54
today is is doing examination on my decision to keep the books in the curriculum based on board policy. And I
3:01
want to make note that we have this policy, right? Every individual in our community has a right under our policy
3:08
to do a reconsideration of books. And we want to do every person in that situation right and fair. And we believe
3:16
we've done that. But I want to acknowledge that we have a policy and it is our best interpretation of that
3:22
policy. Now, as as we begin and then I'll have a few words and then we'll we'll kick it to Shannon who ran the
3:28
process itself. I want to remind our board that the following steps are taken to get policies approved at the district
3:35
level. First, typically a law is passed at the state house. Then ISB writes
3:41
their own policy with their own attorneys. That then is reviewed by allers which
3:47
happens to be our district attorneys as well. Then that ISB policy is also
3:52
reviewed by the department of education's attorneys. Following those conversations, an ISB primmer comes out
3:59
to all school districts. Those primmers are reviewed by the DCG senior leadership team. We
4:06
then bring those policies to the first reading at the board table where there's can be discussion followed by a second
4:12
reading and discussion and ultimately a vote and then if the board approves it
4:17
is policy. So there are numerous steps before a policy gets to be enacted at
4:23
the district level. I would like to take a moment and have the board refer to the board policy history and timeline
4:30
document I shared with you on the front page. I won't spend a lot of time with this, but on the front page, this is our
4:37
work on are there current policies that in any way, shape, or form we believe
4:43
could be tied to objection to instructional materials. As you can see, there's a lot of policies that are in
4:49
there that we attempt to follow. Now, if you'll turn to the second and
4:55
third page with me, as you can see, House File 802 was
5:02
signed into law on June 8th, 2021. Here are some key provisions that were inside
5:07
that law. House File 802 prohibits mandatory trainings or curricula that
5:12
teach, advocate, or promote divisive concepts. These include ideas suggesting that one race or sex is inherently
5:19
superior, that individuals are inherently racist or sexist due to their race or sex, or that the United States
5:25
or Iowa is fundamentally racist or sexist. Also, in that same House File
5:30
802, it explicitly states that it should not be construed to infringe upon First Amendment rights, academic freedom, or
5:38
the intellectual vitality of students and faculty. Discussions of the specified con concepts are permitted
5:44
within academic instruction provided they are presented objectively and are relevant to the course
5:50
material. Okay. So there's some important language certainly in that bill. And now I will have you refer to
5:56
page two. You see that it was passed as I stated on June 8th 2021 at the top of
6:01
page two. So from June 8th, 2021 through May 26,
6:06
2023, there is only one policy primmer update from ISB that even attempts to
6:12
assist school districts with the understanding of House File 802. That primer acknowledged the removal of
6:19
students from any reconsideration committee. So to hopefully clear that up, the only suggestion in those two
6:25
years was that students were not allowed to be a part of the committee. So in two years that is DCG and all other schools
6:33
guidance on House File 802. Remember from MER's attorneys and the Department of Education that's when we receive that
6:41
information. Now I will ask you in the policies I gave you. I won't go through
6:46
all of them. Please refer to the one that says the policy former admin presented to board approval on
6:53
121922. It's probably your third or fourth one in there. The highlighted part says
7:04
121922. If you'll turn with me to page three, you should see an item
7:09
highlighted in green. Do I have
7:15
Brandon? Um, board approval on 121922. Do you see
7:21
that one?
7:26
this part there's like a light very light green sorry second paragraph down
7:32
item H you see an item H that starts the committee okay so this is specific to
7:38
the reconsideration committee but I want to highlight the part in that very light green sorry it wasn't darker following
7:43
the information gathering meeting the review committee shall deliberate in private and shall prepare a written
7:48
recommendation to the superintendent the review committee's recommendation through a simple majority by private
7:54
ballot vote Now I'm going to come back to this in a second. What I want to emphasize that is
8:00
that that was back in 22 was added from a previous board in previous
8:06
administration. Okay. So that policy that line was added. It was not in ISB
8:11
primmer policy. Okay. I want to come back to that in a second because I think it's important to potentially as you review, you know, did we follow policy
8:19
appropriately? Okay. Senate File 496 that is signed into law
8:25
on May 26, 2023. A couple provisions I think are
8:30
important for this board to understand. The law establishes that parents or guardians have a fundamental
8:35
constitutional protected right to make decisions affecting their minor minor children. This encompasses choices
8:41
related to medical care, more and religious upbringing, residence, education, and extracurricular
8:46
activities. The legislation mandates the removal of books containing descriptions or visual
8:52
depictions of sex acts from school libraries. This requirement has led to varying responses from school districts.
8:58
Also in that law, the identity of a parent or guardian who requests the removal of instructional materials shall
9:05
be confidential. As you can see in the timeline, there is very little guidance from May 26, 2023
9:13
to today from the Department of Education regarding this new law. As well, throughout this entire
9:18
reconsideration process, we have been step by step with our district attorneys, bringing them into the fold
9:24
and obtaining their legal advice as we want nothing more to be ethical and to do things the right way. Our attorney
9:31
shared with our team, quote, "It is our opinion that the law does not mandate complete anonymity, but rather the
9:38
person's name is not subject to public records request." Our attorneys went on to explain that the school would have to
9:44
know an individual's name when reconsidering a book, and an individual would lose anonymity if they choose to
9:50
speak in front of the reconsideration committee. Which brings me back to that law I
9:56
referenced just a minute ago when it talks about deliberations are private. On February 25th, 2025, DCG district
10:04
attorney stated to me, quote, "There would be nothing in the law that would allow for the committee to deliberate in
10:10
private. The entire meeting of the committee shall be done so in public." So in accordance with legal guidance, we
10:17
adjusted the reconsideration meeting slightly to allow for public comment and to allow for deliberations by the
10:23
committee to be made in public. Now this is something new we will need to bring to this board table in the near future
10:29
as that one sentence in current district policy does conflict with our legal guidance. We chose in this instant to
10:37
follow legal guidance. We have been steadfast in our partnership in all policies with our legal team. I know
10:44
Shannon's going to touch on this briefly as we had numerous conversations with our our attorneys on what is defined as
10:51
instructional materials. The guidance we received was quote, "It is our position that songs, poems, articles, or other
10:58
supplemental and non-core materials are not under the charge of the reconsideration committee for review.
11:05
This advice was given to us after joint conversations with school district attorneys and department of education
11:10
attorneys. That is why through this entire process, we have focused the complaintant towards curriculum text,
11:16
not ancillary materials. And finally, from working with the complainant to interpreting policy to the best of our
11:23
abilities with guidance from our attorneys every step of the way and what we believe was running a fair, honest,
11:29
and transparent process, we certainly believe that the decision, my decision to leave the challenge books in the
11:35
curriculum was just and appropriate. And with that, I'll turn it over to
11:41
Shannon will reiterate what just said, but starting with
11:47
not used to that. Thanks. Um, so starting with the policy 605.03,
11:53
um, if you look at the last paragraph, that's that top one on there that's labeled A1. Um, if you take a look at
11:59
that last paragraph there, starting with for purposes of prohibiting access to instructional
12:04
materials, Iowa law has defined instructional materials to mean either printed or electronic textbooks and
12:10
related core materials that are written and published primarily for use in elementary school or secondary school
12:15
instruction and are required by a state education agency or district for use in a student's class. Um, and so that was I
12:23
I shared that information that actually mirrors what's in Senate File 496 as well and then was confirmed by our
12:29
conversation with our legal guidance who was also talking with the Department of Education. Um, so just wanted to
12:36
reiterate that because that did kind of guide how we moved this the excuse me as the committee moved forward. Um, so
12:43
following kind of clarifying what it was that we would review, I moved forward with the committee in January. Um
12:50
actually it moved into February a little bit just as we worked to get clarity on what it was that we we would review. Um
12:57
and just want to share you know some of the things that I sent to the committee at that time. Um I shared with them our
13:03
policy around um objections to instructional material. So all the things that you're looking at here um
13:09
the recom or the um instructions to the committee. Um I asked them to send me
13:15
confirmation that they understood what their role was in um in the process. I
13:20
also shared a little bit with them about um how they can become informed about the book by doing their own research
13:26
while also maintaining an understanding that um it is open to or subject to open
13:32
meetings. So they shouldn't be having conversation outside of just their own learning. Um so that was included in
13:39
there. Um just double checking here. So uh we
13:45
made sure that we had clarity on whether um the complainant wanted to speak at the committee meeting and made sure that
13:51
10 minutes was allowed at each of the meetings that we held. Um and we also agreed that we would hear
13:59
from any the other interested persons which is what it references in our policy. So we did allow for public
14:05
comment. Um it also notes pe um persons with special knowledge um which I think
14:10
was maybe a little confusing at times but really the way that we looked at that is what were the questions that I was getting from the committee um as we
14:18
move forward with that. So some of the things that they asked were what other books were considered? How were the
14:23
books selected? What standards are the books used for? What kinds of
14:28
assignments are part of the unit? Um what kinds of discussions did this lead to in the class? and what were the kids'
14:34
general attitude toward that. So, knowing that those were the questions I was receiving for the first meeting, um
14:41
it was really more around how were the books selected and what were the standards. So, I brought in um Julie
14:46
Morgan, our high school instructional co coach to talk about um the the standards
14:51
um and how the books were selected, kind of walking the committee through our um book acquisition process that was just
14:58
developed last year. prior to that there wasn't one in place and so our high school team really worked through
15:03
vetting the books and things like that. Um and then the standards um obviously
15:08
noting what was listed on the reconsideration form which was what uh was that um the books were in violation
15:15
of House File 802. We also brought in Dr. Corenza to the first meeting that we
15:21
held. um he wasn't there able to be there in person. So we shared a video that kind of outlined House File 802 so
15:27
that the committee really understood that was a lot of the questions from the committee is you know what what does
15:33
this mean? How does this apply to the books that you're reading to your instruction? Um and so we felt it was
15:38
important to give them a pretty thorough I think it was about 12 minute video overview of of what that entails and
15:44
what that means for um how we're choosing materials and providing instruction. Um and then in the second
15:50
meeting they asked a lot more about assignments, discussions, that type of thing. Um and so I asked the English
15:58
department to put together um just some information about that. Um which kind of reference that how we chose it. Um how
16:05
we replaced one text with the with another text and really looking at you know do they do they meet the same
16:11
standards? Are they providing the same type of learning for students?
16:16
Um and then so we sh walked through some slides with them that walk through all
16:22
the discussion prompts, the ways that the teachers um establish rules and expectations for students to engage in
16:28
those discussions. Um so really that is just to say who were these people that we chose as people with special
16:35
information. Um that was very much based on the questions that I received from
16:40
from the committee um several times throughout. If if you
16:46
re have read through each of the policies, it reiterates multiple times that our job is to answer the question,
16:51
are the materials appropriate for their intended audience at this time or the intended purpose at this time? Um, and
16:58
so I did redirect the the or not redirect directed the the committee to
17:04
keep that in mind that ultimately that's the question that they're looking to answer through that. Um, so that that
17:10
was really kind of what what we followed. Um I I think you maybe have
17:16
seen I went through line by line and just kind of outlined how each of these were were met. Um each line in the
17:23
policy um including all of my communication to to the committee um and
17:29
what those expectations were. I think that's really really it to
17:35
to cover all the ways that that we went through that policy. Thank you both. Does the board have any
17:42
questions for Dr. Bloom or Mrs.
17:51
Olsen? Seeing none, we'll move along to item A4. Would the appelllet please come
17:56
to the table and turn on the mic.
18:07
The appellent will be allotted up to 15 minutes to present the basis for the appeal. I'll keep track of time. At the
18:14
end of 14 minutes, I'll raise my hand as a visual cue to begin concluding your comments. We ask the board to hold any
18:21
questions until the presenters comments have concluded. You may begin. Okay. Um
18:28
DCG board members, parents, and friends. Good evening and thank you. So, I thank you guys for being here tonight. Um, I'm
18:34
here to see seek your guidance regarding the serious issue with English 2 curriculum at Dallas Center Grimes High
18:39
School, which I do believe violates our own schoolboard policy 60309 in regards to balance of
18:46
perspective when discussing divisive topics and with House File 802. The
18:52
English 2 curriculum includes two long units heavily focused on critical race theory and social social justice
18:59
featuring materials that portray America as inherently rooted in white supremacy
19:05
and anti-American sentiment. One unit on the American dream presents a uniformly
19:11
negative view suggesting that success is unattainable for minorities or protected
19:17
classes with no examples of achievement. The district claims compliance with
19:23
House File 802, which prohibits race-based stereotyping and divisive concepts in education. Yet, they have
19:30
not removed or adjusted the materials despite my concerns are raised raised since September 10th of 2024.
19:38
Additionally, the content such as magazine articles, poems, songs, movies, expert, excerpts, and books is race
19:44
centric and lacks any balanced perspective steering students toward a singular
19:51
ideological conclusion. What makes me feel that this is one-sided or unbalanced? Um, well, parents and
19:58
students have shared concerns and the materials are Americanborn Chinese. I was their
20:05
American dream. This is my America with a chapter titled America with three K's in the middle of it.
20:13
Um the article why the American dream is unrecognizable today. MKTO's American
20:19
dream where the American dream is pretty much dead in that song. Steinbeck's the
20:25
paradox of dreams. Gorman's poem the hill we climb. excerpt from Michelle
20:30
Obama's book Obama's book becoming content from
20:35
Junth and the film Just Mercy which emphasizes racial identity systemic
20:40
racism and critiques the American dream often presenting one-sided view of America as
20:47
unjust. Um, plus a commentary letter assignment even guides kids to conclude
20:53
white skin equals priv privilege with lines like being white made you extra
20:58
special. This isn't critical thinking. It is compel compelled speech violating
21:03
our policy um our policies call for fair objection
21:09
and discussion. The district's response has been inadequate and misleading. They have framed my request as a
21:16
reconsideration of materials, limiting it to two books, but my concern extends
21:21
to the entire unit's content, including other materials. I've learned that the
21:26
district's attorney advised the district not to include these additional materials, articles, songs, additional
21:32
books. But why? I have I have a good idea. um the the district refuses to
21:41
address them compre comprehensively. Furthermore, the curriculum violates our own schoolboard policy of 60309 which
21:48
mandates balance when presenting divisive concepts. Instead, the educator
21:54
and English 2 team who have taught variations of this curriculum for at least five years with past assignments
21:59
on critical race theory, gun rights, social justice, BLM consistently push a
22:05
one-sided narrative. this year even including the commentary ladder proving the intent design for seventh grade also
22:13
the design for seventh grade reading level u material instead of 10th grade reading level material the district's
22:19
handling of the process has been obstructive and drawn out since I first raised question on the issue initially
22:26
they formed a reconsideration committee with an administrator teacher librarian who works directly with that teacher and
22:32
the English team teachers um and two community members ers, but confidential
22:37
details were leaked by the teacher librarian to Annie's Foundation, a loud,
22:43
ruthless group who will publicly smear anyone who disagrees with them. That includes five months of bullying both
22:49
myself and our district. The confidential information was also leaked to one of the authors by the same
22:56
district employee, which made um what was meant to be a safe and quiet part of the process to go nationwide. The intent
23:05
is not to lack transparency. It is protect is to protect the parent district and committee members both from
23:13
harm and outside influence. Just as a jury is not allowed to converse about a
23:18
case or a trial as it goes on to the board. That is when it becomes public
23:24
and anyone can be you know part of and involved if it makes it to that part.
23:29
Right? So in this case, the employee drove the narrative with this is a quote
23:35
book ban before the committee could even meet. This fueled a false narrative despite my consistent request to add
23:42
materials for balance, not remove books entirely. After submitting my initial
23:48
concern regarding the two units, I met with the superintendent and discussed the materials. He assured me that only
23:53
one teacher was using the supplemental materials in question. During our conversation, we considered um convening
24:00
the committee to assess the reading level of the true graphic novels and their value over the classics or value
24:07
over the classics that we've removed. However, I later discovered that the English two teachers were you that other
24:14
English two teacher teachers were utilizing the same supplemental materials to convey the same concept.
24:21
Consequencely, consequently, I emailed the superintendent to return to my original request a comprehensive
24:28
reconsideration of all materials used in the two units. The district then announced, "This is a reconsideration of
24:34
two specific books to the entire community, intensify intensifying public
24:40
scrutiny since December of 24. Our communications director did an
24:45
Axios interview. I've faced relentless harassment from a couple teachers,
24:50
community members, Annie's foundation, and meanwhile, the the district has
24:55
stonewalled, changed policies mid-process, and failed to address the broader curriculum issues. With all of
25:02
that happening, do you think any committee member would have spoke up if they
25:08
disagreed? I was told we could only use two books at a time and the committee was was even directed to only consider
25:15
the books individually, not any other parts of the material or how they are
25:21
being used between hoops, research, and stolen walling. It's been a long process. I believe that I believe the
25:28
district's actions or lack thereof violate both state law and our own policies. I've never asked for the books
25:35
to be banned. I've sought compliance with House File 802 and a balance of
25:40
curriculum that reflects diverse perspectives as our schoolboard policy requires. The educator's history of
25:48
ideological assignments and the district's refusal to correct this combined with their public mishandling
25:54
of the resulting harassment have left me with no choice but to seek your help.
26:00
And I'm here to discuss that process. Um, where am I at on time?
26:08
You're about seven minutes in. Okay. Okay. So, I have a couple couple different afterthoughts. So, um the core
26:16
objective of the reconsideration of instructional materials process is to ensure that both instructional resources
26:22
are suitable for their for their educational objectives while honoring the diverse viewpoints within our
26:29
community. My advocacy was never intended to foster division or controversy within the esteemed DCG
26:36
community. Notably, numerous districts um in numerous districts, the
26:42
reconsideration committee convenes in a matter similar to a standard me. So, not
26:47
announced like a schoolboard meeting. It would be like sc committee or or something like that. That is what we see
26:54
in our neighboring districts. Furthermore, it is customary in many
27:00
districts to maintain confidentiality of the complaintant through throughout the committee's deliberations with their
27:06
identity only disclosed if the matter advances to the school board
27:12
level.
27:18
Um, and the other part of the process is don't we want parents
27:24
involved? I've heard mixed conversations in our community. I've heard people
27:30
um I've heard teachers say uh in our community that we don't want why are
27:37
these parents getting involved and then I've heard parents saying why can't we be involved? There's got to be some kind
27:42
of a middle ground there. Um my heart is to help make our
27:48
district the destination district. We need to retain our families. We need to
27:54
have solid reputation of exceptional reasons why we attract new students and
28:00
wouldn't it make sense to have less divisive topics or at least a balance of
28:06
perspective. Um and then the other the other part that I wanted to talk about a little bit is um as we were going
28:13
through this I did seek counsel from the um budsman office. So, if you're not
28:18
aware of what they do, um, they work on policy for the state of Iowa. Um, and
28:26
you know, kind of had those conversations of, okay, am I crazy thinking that the policy means this or
28:32
does it really mean this or you know, you know, where where does that lie?
28:37
There are some, you know, discrepancies in policy. There are some different areas that districts can make it
28:44
personalized to their district, but laying that out very clearly for the
28:49
parent and the community is very important. Um, it's been a a long road
28:55
and I do believe that we can do better in this process. Um, protect the students, protect the parents and also
29:02
the entire district. So, as far as um what I hope our district takes away
29:10
from this is we want to bring unity for one, stop being
29:17
divisive, and go back to all of the things that make us proud when it comes to DCG. So,
29:25
I thank you for your time. Thank you. Does the board have any questions?
29:33
Seeing none, thank you very
29:40
much. I'll move us along to item B. Uh the board needs to take action. Uh the
29:46
board has really three options here. The board can affirm the superintendent's
29:51
decision, modify the superintendent's decision, or reverse the superintendent's decision. Looking for a
29:59
motion.
30:06
I move to affirm the superintendent's decision. Looking for a second. Second, Dickinson. Any discussion?
30:17
Seeing none, I'll Yeah, I appreciate uh Shel coming out and I would agree and echo. I think there's been a lot of
30:23
things on a community basis that probably could have been handled better. Um, and I hope in the future that some
30:30
attacks and stuff like that don't happen because obviously we want parents involved. And I think um, this brings up
30:35
a good conversation for us as a board. I think going forward, what does balance look like? Um, and I think we want to be
30:41
a destination school. We're critical thinking. It's fine if you have a view that you don't like as long as we're
30:46
kind of showing the other side. And, um, you know, I would agree with that. This obviously is a different thing right
30:51
here, but I think long term this opens up something that we can look at um to make sure all parents, you know, feel
30:57
like they have a seat at the table. They can come and talk to us. They can come and talk to you, which I know you're open doors. So, I appreciate it. Takes a
31:04
lot of uh gumption to come up and especially after you faced a lot of things like that. So, I appreciate you
31:09
coming forward today. Any other discussion?
31:17
I'll move us along to vote. All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Oppose.
31:22
Same sign. I. Motion carries.
31:28
The um next regular board meeting will be April 28th at 5:30 p.m. Looking for a
31:36
motion to adjurnn. Move to adjurnn. Dickinson. For a second. Second. Vanderbel.
