3:44
C, the job descriptions for director of maintenance and grounds and director of custodial services and buildings. Um
3:50
so are we taking the director of op operations position and splitting that into two?
3:57
We have a we have a currently a director of operations and assistant director of
4:02
operations. Okay. Okay. So, we're really taking those two responsibilities from two people, moving them into two
4:08
director roles to separate um kind of that department into kind of two
4:14
functioning silos. Under those silos, are you anticipating there will be additional help under
4:21
those like are we going to eventually be hiring more people to round out these silos? Yeah, we would love to. Um but um
4:29
that has been a struggle this year when we tried to do that. tried to hire additional Hback help and couldn't do
4:35
it. So, yeah, would would love to moving forward, but probably not on the table for this upcoming year. And then in
4:41
these job descriptions, um there aren't any salaries listed probably because
4:46
they're just job descriptions. Um we have on the agenda later in the meeting,
4:53
um a contract for $115,000 for director of maintenance and grounds. What is the
4:59
anticipated pay or what is the pay for the other? It will be the same 115,000.
5:04
Okay. Yep. Thank you. You betcha. Any other discussion?
5:10
All those in favor indicate by saying I. I. Post same sign. Motion
5:16
carries. Um any questions on the written
5:21
reports? There are no building level presentations this evening. So we'll move along to 9C. uh the decap
5:29
updates. Um Dr. Krenza and I think you've got some help as well.
5:36
Yes, we have some fantastic help. Uh so today we want to give you an update. This is an annual update for us on the
5:44
district career and academic plan. Uh we shorten that by DECAP. And you'll know
5:50
we'll kind of use interchangeably DECAP, the district side, the work that we do to tie it all together and IAP, the
5:57
individual career and academic plans. Those are the plans that the students do individually to indicate their interest
6:04
in career areas. So, um, do you want to introduce yourselves and your role and then we'll get going? I'll talk.
6:11
Um, Austin Roy, one of the assistant principles at the high school. Joe Kend, principal at OPQ.
6:18
I'm Nathan Gross, school counselor at the high school, and I'm so happy that they're here. We also have several other
6:25
members of our team from Oak View. We have Sarah Rose, um, guidance counselor, and Emily Wah. And this has been a fun
6:32
team to work with. So, just to give a backup, a little context for our brief presentation, um, back go back one year
6:39
ago today, um, it was a year where we literally kind of rebuilt from the ground up. And that's what you're going
6:45
to hear through this theme is we had some growing pains with some turnover and leadership at the district level,
6:51
but also new players to the DECAP team. All of that process comes with learning
6:56
the terminology and the expectations. This plan comes out to be about 35 to 40
7:02
pages. Um some can grow up to 60 pages in length. So they're quite um quite
7:07
arduous to put together, but a really thorough process. So I want to thank this team. They met several times a
7:13
year. We don't meet necessarily on a regularly basis, but we try to come together as it really involves going
7:18
deep down into classroom level instruction. Um, student work with students. We look at district level
7:24
activities that we're doing. And, um, for us, I think it's kind of been a labor of love, but we're going to let
7:29
them give some information about where they're going and where they've been.
7:36
So starting off this slide is not the most visually appealing way to go about it, but to honest to goodness, this is
7:42
what we felt um as we kind of took over this decap process where um we were
7:48
taking a lot of the great things that are going on at DCG and we were just shoving it in a suitcase as best as we
7:53
could. Did we have a rhyme or reason of what we were doing and why? No. But we just knew that they were good and they knew they need to come along. um but
7:59
just kind of led to a process like this and this is kind of what it's felt. Um as Dr. Kren alluded to, a lot of our uh
8:07
change over within the district office within Oak View and within the high school the last couple years have led us
8:13
to kind of being in that spot where um in essence we took what the teams did
8:19
ahead of us and we did our best with it. Um so looking back into last year it
8:24
really was um in the 23 24 year where we presented last year it was a reproduction of what had been done
8:30
before us and then documented what we were doing that current year. It was a big big learning year. Um other things
8:37
that we did last year that we talked about is again teaching our staff about decap um and how we use it. Um getting a
8:42
staff survey to truly understand um where we're at and where we want to go. Um and we did do some additions to some
8:48
of our programming with the future freshman parent night that we did again this year and we've had it grew um a
8:55
great amount from last year into this year. So seeing our parents starting to engage with some of this programming was
9:00
really really positive and again the essence of what our work was was do our best to stuff it in the suitcase and
9:05
send it off to the state. Um and the results that we got back from
9:11
that from the the plan that we presented last year um we we got an average score.
9:16
Um a couple things that I want to talk about that in terms of that average score. Our score did drop um from last
9:23
year's two years ago playing to this year. But the rubric also changed. It increased um how they score and what
9:30
their criterion were. Um but the fact that we dropped not only kind of told us that um we were missing the mark in
9:37
terms of what the state wanted us to do, but we were also missing the mark of what was best for kids. Um we got
9:43
frustrated a little bit. We felt like we sent a similar report onto the state and to to get our score drop um was kind of
9:50
a you know it was a gut punch. Um however, as we've kind of talked with um
9:56
representative from the state, um Erica Woods, who works with the Department of Ed, I worked with Angela D'vorak, um
10:02
they helped us kind of reshift our thinking of this isn't just a compliance thing. This isn't just, you know,
10:08
anytime you put a score onto something, you automatically get competitive with it. You automatically um feel like
10:14
you're getting judged, and to an extent, you are. Um but a big mantra that we tried to go with and grow with this year
10:21
within our decap team is kind of taking that shift of comparison to growth. Um
10:26
and as we say here uh and Dr. Kren was talking about this that when we compare ourselves to a score when we compare
10:31
ourselves to other district it really is going to be a thief of joy. So, we tried to shift our mindset into a lot of
10:37
growth and and I think it's been a really exciting year to kind of figure out not um you know what can we do to
10:44
increase our score, yes, but what should we truly be doing uh to increase this uh
10:50
this plan's effectiveness to meet the academic and career future needs of our students. Um, so really what we kind of
10:59
talked about this year is LA like taking this giant cluttered suitcase and let's throw things out. Let's move everything
11:06
out of the suitcase and only put things back in when they're on a purpose for a purpose. So, we took a look at some of
11:12
our quick wins, um, our long-term goals, and and to be honest, like from the work done ahead of us and even our current
11:18
work, we saw that there weren't really any articulated long-term or short-term goals, and we wanted to take some time
11:24
to figure out what what are the goals um figure out our celebrations. We spent a
11:29
lot of time unpacking um the feedback that we got in last year's plan to figure out what direction
11:35
should we go. um got a lot of uh feedback from H Heartland staff and the department of ed to figure out what we
11:42
should be doing. Again, not to get a better score, but what should we be doing because it's best for our kids here at
11:51
DCG? Uh yeah. So, I get to talk about what we did this year. So, um, we
11:58
started out at the beginning back in the fall, um, in a big meeting with a bunch of other schools, um, where we set some
12:06
we we chose we identified some quick wins. Uh, we set some long-term goals.
12:13
This, what you're seeing here is mostly like a um, brainstorming session. So, a
12:20
lot of this stuff didn't make it into like the actual plan, but we were talking about like what could we do long
12:25
term? Um, what are some like big hairy audacious goals? Like what's something crazy that we could look at doing? Um,
12:33
what are things that we're already doing that we can celebrate right now? Um, so that's where we started out at the
12:40
beginning of the year. Um, the next thing we did is we took a look at what our feedback was.
12:47
So, we looked at last year's scores. Um, we saw, uh, the areas that we could
12:53
improve quickly. Um, we identified areas that we were going to need to improve over a longer period of time. Um, and we
13:00
really dove into each section and looked at like what was the feedback that we
13:06
got and what what can we do right now to have an impact on that.
13:12
Uh so we sat down in a meeting and we did an action plan. Um it was kind of
13:18
the first step at looking okay this is the feedback that we got. Um what are
13:25
some things that we can do uh and like in the time frame that we have right
13:31
now? Um how long do we need in order to be able to address the issues that we
13:37
saw? Um and what's the first thing that we needed to do?
13:42
So, uh, with that in mind, we wanted to start by getting things kind of in order. Um, we wanted to go at this with
13:50
a purpose as opposed to, you saw the mess at the beginning. We didn't want to just shove everything in. We wanted
13:56
every piece that went into the suitcase to have a purpose. Um, we wanted to be organized in the way that we did it. We
14:02
wanted to have an identified plan um as far as um how we can get all of the
14:08
pieces in that we had um and then what what did we want to
14:15
prioritize? So we started out by asking um parents, we started with our uh
14:20
future freshman parents um during our future freshman night. We asked them like what's important to you? What do
14:26
you want to know more about over the next four years? and they told us very clearly they wanted us to focus on
14:32
career exploration um postsecary exploration and then um your career and
14:39
post-secondary uh decision- making. So how do you uh decide where to go after
14:45
high school? Um what does that training look like? Um what type of uh post-secary options
14:53
do students have? How does that tie into what their interests are? how does that
14:59
tie into um what they can do while they're at the high school? And then also career exploration is, you know,
15:06
just looking at like all the careers that are available, trying to match that up with their career interests, with
15:12
their personality styles, all of those types of
15:19
things. All right. So then now we get now we get to dream, right? So, we've
15:25
kind of we've seen where we were. This year, we really kind of got a grip on
15:30
where we currently are and what we want to do. So, moving forward, we really want to focus on how counselors can get
15:38
into the high school classes and then also thinking about what we're doing at Oakview in the seventh and eighth grade
15:44
to help support that. So, that way it's kind of that scaffolded process. um continue working with teachers so that
15:50
way they understand the DECAP process, what it is, what is best for our students um to actually create a true
15:58
timeline. That way we can um Wow, words just lost me. They got hard. So we can
16:03
guarantee students an experience with work um whether that's work-based learning, whether that's just a career
16:09
experience, internships, whatever that might be. Um but then we have an actual outlined um way to do that. So, we're
16:16
looking to do that by 2026. Um, then we want to look at our
16:21
required courses and then their role in supporting all of those essential components. Thinking about FAFSA, is
16:28
that something that's done in financial literacy or is that something that's done in nth grade English? And you start comparing little things, right? So, that
16:35
we're planning for spring 2027. Um then kind of taking our future freshman night
16:42
um and turning that more into like a webinar series that would have something for every single grade. That way maybe
16:49
eighth grade is in person and nth grade is in person but then after that we got a lot of feedback that some parents
16:54
couldn't make it but they really wanted the information. So then how can we take that same presentation and turn it into
17:00
a webinar and then this will kind of grow with that current eighth grade class. So that way by the time they're
17:05
seniors, parents would have learned everything that they might possibly need to hear from the counselors. Um, and then also thinking
17:12
about just how does this fit with our strategic planning process because we'll need to find a way to mesh that instead
17:19
of adding or instead of it being separate. So when we're thinking about
17:25
how we're going to align that, right, we have our theory of action phase. It's currently where we are, right? So now
17:30
it's our time to think ahead. How does DECAP fit in? Um, so we'll start with
17:36
those action cards. Again, we're just getting started with that as you know. So, it's going to be one where that
17:41
probably won't play in until next year, but then creating our own action cards. Um, and then again, coming back to um
17:49
that capacity with our DAP leadership team. We're looking for a few more people to add in. I think that we've
17:56
talked about at Oakview's level our um future ready course that teacher because
18:01
that's what they're talking about is careers. So adding that then thinking about at the high school level are we
18:06
good where we are do we need to add to and what do we need to learn to then better support um and then we're just
18:13
going to be super honest right like we knew where we were. We're not there yet we're still going to work on it and by
18:19
the end I mean it's going to be continual growth. Uh, so like I said, we're we're
18:26
going to be focusing on goals, not where we were. We're going to use our data to
18:31
make sure that we're driving our actions. Um, we're going to really dig into the definitions within the IAP and
18:37
the DECAP, so that way we're rooting it in what the state is wanting, but also best practice, what's best for students.
18:44
Um, and then we'll really need to make sure that our infrastructure matches the support that we're needing. So the TLC
18:50
role, the addition of the CTE curriculum facilitator will really support that as well because then they can kind of see
18:57
the systems level view which can help us with all of our decision- making um in
19:02
the smaller parts of the system leading up to that. Um and then looking at our school counseling program K12, right?
19:10
How are we supporting students throughout their journey so that way um by the time that they graduate they feel
19:16
prepared for that next step. That is all that we got.
19:24
So we submitted this plan um at the end of March and earlier today um Dr. Kren
19:29
and I attended a a scoring activity um where um all schools that are in the H
19:35
Heartland Aea Regency got together and they did a peer scoring um of the plan
19:41
that we submitted for this year. Um, for each of the different criteria, there are there's a novice, there's a
19:48
developing, um, a proficient and advanced. Um, that's kind of the the so
19:53
a zero to threepoint scale. Um, last year on that zero to three point scale for all the sections, we got a a 16 out
20:00
of 36. Uh, which again statewide is average, but um, a lot of those were in the developing areas. um with the work
20:07
that we did to actually scale things back um our initial score that we received today was a 27 um out of 36. So
20:15
so a and uh in all of the areas um except for one we were proficient or
20:21
advanced um which was really cool to be able to see and goes to the work of our entire team. Um the one spot that we
20:28
were not uh proficient in was our work-based learning. Um, and interestingly enough, when we did that
20:34
par parental survey, that was the area that our parents are currently interested in the least right now. Um,
20:40
so I think that and that kind of told us that that matches a little bit with we have our priorities to reach all
20:46
students. Um, and to be honest just with um in terms of um resources and
20:52
infrastructure uh both um human capital and and monetary the workbased learning is the biggest scariest um area to
21:00
invest in. Um, so knowing that that eventually is an area that we want to grow in, um, but we have some time to
21:05
get there. Um, but I think just for the board to be aware that that would be something that we because we're kind of maxed out, uh, with our workbased
21:12
learning under our certain, um, you know, under our current infrastructure. So, knowing that's area we want to grow,
21:18
but our community is kind of saying, but what we have right now is is in a pretty decent spot. And again, that's an
21:24
initial score um because it was kind of done by a peer um, a peer review with other districts. So that that score
21:30
could could change. But before we turn it over to questions, so if you haven't had an eighth grade, if you have
21:36
somebody eighth grade or older, you're already probably aware of this. You see it in the plans that you have to review with your kids and and understand as
21:43
they progress through high school where this looks at. We are, if you have somebody that's in elementary, we're
21:48
looking to expand our work with Zello, which is the career development software, looking to do that at K5. And
21:54
so working to get that in place um for years to come here. That's one of our goals. We also want to look at how are
22:01
we how are we more inclusive with our students so that all of our students in special programs e TAG special education
22:08
that those students also have equal access to this same sort of learning. That will be a growth piece for us as
22:13
well. Um but I would say we simply could not do the things we do without this
22:19
team behind us. And each of us on that team plays a different role. Um but that's and that's the way it's designed
22:25
to be. um whether you're counseling high school students, whether you're the principal and you're organizing systems
22:31
work. Um I want to thank our entire team and looking to expand that team. Uh as
22:36
far as the board, this is an annual requirement that we present to you each year. So we'll always come back in April
22:42
and give you information and if you want it sooner than that, we certainly can do that. But we think April gives us a nice
22:48
chance to show growth over the year, have some of that scoring information, but also tell you it's a work in
22:53
progress. can be really hard when you're sitting in a room as we were today with the Ankenes and Walke and and uh
23:00
certainly districts over 10,000 or more. Their work we're all required to do the
23:05
same thing even the district that has 300 kids in it but it looks different by each location. So that's why I like
23:11
their scoring system today where like-siz districts are able to talk about resources. So with that, thank you
23:16
to all of you for presenting today. Do you have any questions for us?
23:23
Maybe just a just a big thank you. Um, you know, maybe a a couple of things there that you know, getting feedback
23:31
from those incoming freshman parents I'm sure is huge. And then sounds like that's really where you focused and really moved the needle a lot in that
23:37
space. and then you know giving um you know a lot of good work to really
23:45
building up those and I'm sure you'll advance those other areas maybe that are maybe less important to to the parents
23:51
and the students as as we move along. But thanks a ton for that. One question, when do uh kids do do they complete the
23:58
IAP? Is that kind of at the end of seminar in eighth grade or when when does that happen? Yeah. So during their
24:04
eighth grade year, they'll finish their four-year plan which will feed into that IAP and technically it's not really
24:10
truly engaged with until high school. Okay. Yep. But they they do have an IAP as a freshman then. And does that
24:17
continue to evolve then throughout the It's still under that four-year plan, but I want you can speak better to that.
24:23
Yeah. So, uh it's not really IAP as much as it's a four-year plan. And so they're
24:28
like planning out what they have throughout their whole high school experience. And then really we start the
24:35
IAP or DECAP experience like in 8th grade um where they're doing some
24:40
learning in a what's that class called? Future. The future ready class. Um and
24:45
and then it's designed to be used like throughout from essentially 8th grade
24:50
all the way through their senior year. Yeah. Great. Thank you. Does board have
24:56
any other questions? Thank you. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.
25:02
We'll give Dr. Krenza a minute to get seated and situated and then he can give us an update.
25:11
Okay. Um I'm going to go through a couple of uh important information for you pretty quickly. The first is just
25:17
state reporting updates. Uh we're going to begin the process right now. actually are actively involved in uh SRRI, the
25:24
student uh reporting in Iowa, where we'll just uh begin to look at courses
25:29
and assessments, making sure everything aligns for the state. Uh pretty standard work. Spring Beds is also open now. So
25:36
that's the one where we look at um school hours, school calendar, look at bullying and harassment, seclusion and
25:42
restraint data. We just upload those numbers to the state emergency operation plans verification. And so we're
25:49
actually probably about 50% of the way through that. So it should be done pretty quickly. Um professional development, as
25:55
you can see there, our schedule. Um I I do want to thank our principles and our instructional coaches and Dr. Bloom. We
26:02
I think I mentioned before that we've added in safety training this spring that wasn't originally on our calendar.
26:07
And our teams have done an incredible job. So anywhere that there was a district PD, we had three things. We had
26:14
the strong framework that we needed to go over. We had school improvement planning that we need to go over and
26:19
then say what did I say? Safety, school improvement and strong and so uh each
26:24
building because of the timing has just flex flexed so well. I'm so thankful that um I think this schedule allows for
26:32
that and that was really a good use of our time and resources and and dividing and conquering that way. So we are
26:38
actually nearing the end. um we had our last flex day and sad s I'm kind of sad
26:43
to see those go because as much as um we dig in with those special teams and you can see there by the listing that's some
26:50
of the most impactful work that those teams have done uh I'm so thankful that they gave of their time and the
26:56
individuals that we've had come in and lead lead that work um to think how far and I oversee nurses and our tag
27:02
teachers both of those groups have done absolutely phenomenal work as I know have our special ed teachers so um We
27:09
will keep that same structure for next year, but we're done for flex days. We'll wrap up uh the remainder of May
27:15
will mostly be time for buildings, which makes sense. They're going to engage in school improvement planning, get their
27:21
goals lined up, and then they'll have the last two uh early dismissals of the year for building time. So, how do we
27:28
wrap up the year? How do we, you know, make sure grading is done and all those things that come with closing out a
27:33
school year? um isas I'm excited to uh be able to uh get
27:41
our data starting to come in and there is um uh I would say significant growth
27:48
in many areas and celebrations that we have we have areas that we'll continue to work on but the initial data that's
27:54
come in it is not clean data fully so I can't really share that out but it gives
28:00
us an idea of where we're at so testing is now in the what I call wrap-up stage.
28:06
So, we are picking up people who have not yet been tested, maybe were ill or absent for whatever reason. I think we
28:13
are down probably under about 10 students that we need to do that. We have sent in tomorrow morning we'll send
28:19
in our paper testing. So, that's off our list. And then we'll go back through and just make sure we've accounted for
28:25
everybody um identifying with the state who is um if they did not test, which we
28:31
do every year have some students who um do not test and we have to indicate the reason why and check that off with the
28:37
state. Lastly, just as a measure of how um amazing our staff uh well, elementary
28:43
through secondary have been last year, we submitted uh five test security um uh
28:51
what you call them reports to the state of Iowa. They they are just saying, "Hey, we might have made an error
28:56
somewhere or there was student access to phones." This year we've had one. And so
29:02
our staff have really taken the challenge of making sure that we have a secure test environment to heart and
29:08
done some incredible improvements. This is a massive lift. Nancy probably knows how how much goes into that from the
29:14
testing side. Um I just cannot thank it. It becomes almost a daily thing for two
29:20
or three weeks at each building. So thankful for for their work there. Questions about those before I um
29:27
bring up some special guests who are a lot better at this than I am. questions about any of
29:35
those. Okay. Well, I want to introduce uh I'll talk for a second. Two very
29:40
special people. Um Callie Cidle, said that right side and Ally Anderson. And
29:47
they are high schoolers at Dallas Grimes High School. And they are illustrative members of our wellness committee. And
29:54
um I want to start by uh first welcoming you here. and they're a little nervous, but they don't need to be uh because
30:00
they have been a key part of this group and I know um Nancy and Shaylee have been a part of this committee as well to
30:06
say. I just want to start really quickly with the process and where we've been. Uh we had some work to do with our
30:12
wellness policies along the way with a trienal assessment that somewhere along the line um we were out of compliance
30:19
with. So over the course of the year with their help and the help of all our
30:24
participants, what you have for you tonight down in the first reading is the first reading of updated wellness
30:30
policies that I think are it's exciting thinking how much work we've put into
30:36
them and the direction of where we're going. So we'll ask for your approval or if you have questions about them, we can
30:41
answer them at that time, too. Uh but if you remember this really uh we were required to have a trienal assessment
30:47
every three years. is we must look at both of our policies. I call that the unfun work. It's not bad work, it's just
30:54
unfun work, right? Yeah. Okay. Look at them. They know no one did not. Um because looking at policies is always
30:59
hard. Um our original policies were just a bit out of order. They didn't have bad information in them. But you will see um
31:07
in the regulation, we did almost a complete re rewrite of it so that we
31:12
could make it in a logical format that matched um our assessments that we're doing that we have to do. and our
31:18
reflections. So, I think we saw some strengths that we um really focused on the wellness committee. Uh it's the
31:25
first time we've had a sustained committee work for a while. We had participants from um every building. We
31:31
had participants from the community. Um we had every and we've sent thank yous to them. But students, we have even had
31:38
an Oakview student with us as well. And that student representation is really important. Um but what we've done is our
31:45
wellness policy was in good shape. We are not recommending any changes for that. We are recommending significant
31:51
changes just formatting mostly to our wellness regulation. Um where do we go
31:58
from here? Well, we need to increase our partnership with Chartwells. Um they've been a key partner. Donna Savage um has
32:06
been a part and um now Jennifer Ty has been joined us. So they are and Amy from
32:12
Chartwells. They have been excellent participants. They want to be there. They have answered questions. At the
32:18
start of the year, Amy even did a survey, so she gathered information about what people wanted to know about Chartwells. Um, we did this
32:24
comprehensive review. We know we need to continue to do that. Our building uh principles will be asked to complete a
32:33
um it's really called a report card, so to speak, where we will assess each
32:39
building and the district's level of performance in relation to those wellness goals that you'll see in the
32:44
regulation. We don't have to be highly proficient at all of them, but that gives us the data
32:49
as to how we want to proceed. And then um as I told uh these lovely ladies, the
32:54
real fun work starts next year where we get to dream big, where we get to really
33:00
start to think about what does wellness look like in our schools. And while some things might already be prescribed to us
33:06
in the policy such as healthy snacks, vending machines, food service regulations, those kinds of things, um
33:13
what what gets exciting is thinking about farmtotable. So is this a situation where we could use gardens,
33:19
which some of our schools have gardens to then uh uh plant and harvest and
33:25
bring those foods into our food service program or into our classrooms. Uh we do
33:30
need to look at our smart snack policy. So we will need to get out to parents next year information about what
33:36
constitutes a healthy snack and how can we encourage more of that. And then u
33:41
this is a chance for us to increase communication to stakeholders uh where we can update SCAK. We can um send out
33:49
communications by state code. We have to have some publications in the Mustang monthly and on our website. So we'll
33:55
make sure people have access to the wellness um information that we've done. So that's just a a brief overview of of
34:02
strengths and areas for improvements for us. Uh would you like to talk a little bit about your role and what you learned
34:07
on the committee? Um so we did a lot of talking about one the boring policies.
34:13
Um and yeah and then two just a lot of things that like us students can
34:18
participate in. So one of the things that we talked about that I can kind of relate to is the student gardens. So, I
34:25
know at Oakview they have like garden boxes in the little like outdoor uh classroom areas they have and in Botney
34:32
here at the high school I took botney. I know uh Mr. Harvard has plants like uh basil, parsley, he was growing tomatoes
34:39
at one point. So, there's lots of opportunities where we could grow um different fruits and vegetables and like
34:45
all these things that we can use in the school cafeteria and stuff like that. Very good. Allie, you want to add
34:50
anything? Mhm. So yeah, that's they really illustrate a key point of where we'll be going is as we sat on our last
34:57
night together. We started brainstorming of like the connections that start to happen where they could grow the plants
35:04
in botany plant, you know, students could then plant them. They could write an advertisement in English class about
35:11
the food that's going to be previewed in the school. I mean, there's so many connections. It reminds me a lot of
35:16
decap in that we are starting at the beginning. This is very early. uh but but the sky's is the limit for us and
35:22
these uh folks here should be the driver of a lot of our work. Uh one example and do you want to share about um movement
35:29
and how we've talked about um the need for movement and activity in between classes or during classes? Yeah.
35:36
So, um, so during our second period Spanish class, halfway through the period, which is an hour and 30 minutes,
35:42
so it's kind of a long time to just be sitting still. Um, we go out in the pod and we either do some yoga or maybe we
35:48
go for like a walk around the school, something that literally takes 5 minutes. It also gives us a chance to
35:53
get up and go to the bathroom so we're not wasting class time on that. And I don't know about you, but I feel like
35:59
personally after we do that, I'm always more focused and ready because before I'm so ready to just like get up and
36:06
move because I'm so tired of sitting and then afterwards I'm like, "Okay, now I'm ready to learn and finish working on
36:12
whatever whatever I need to." So, I feel like it'd be really good if if we do that every period and all it is is five
36:18
minutes. It's not long at all. It's barely a change to classes really.
36:23
I find that their perspective at that table is so much more helpful um both from a parent lens as a parent myself of
36:31
high schoolers u but also as you know for the teachers that are there to hear or the nurse we had a ton of
36:36
representation um where we'll start next year is just really identifying what's possible um so
36:43
some of that work can happen with identifying snacks and those pieces and communication out it may be also getting
36:49
in front of PTO's we'll look at things like recess or do we insure enough recess at each of our buildings. Do we
36:55
have enough um like I said break time? And I always laugh when we lead PD, we have to break after about 25 30 minutes
37:02
because the adults need a stretch. Same is true for kids. So, we have to think about our instructional blocks. And it's
37:07
nobody's fault if they're doing anything that doesn't meet with what the policy guideline is. But it is important that
37:12
we consider this. Um Ally, anything you want to add? What was your favorite part?
37:18
Um, I like going off of what she said, I would say like even with that, there's kids in high school at least that only
37:25
have PE like one semester. And so if you think about it, they're not getting any exercise like throughout the day. They
37:31
don't get any breaks or anything besides like passing time, which you're just walking to your next class and you don't
37:37
really get like a mental break. Yeah. So that movement are things that we probably don't think of. we probably
37:43
don't give it any thought especially if you have to move from one end of the building completely to the other end you don't even get a chance to do some
37:49
socialization. Um yeah you also mentioned food service in the building. Do you have thoughts you want to share
37:55
about the difference in food service that you see? Um, so the difference that we've noticed is both lunchrooms kind of
38:01
serve different foods, but every like Monday, Wednesday, and Friday they serve like nachos and then on Tuesdays and
38:08
Thursdays they serve sandwiches, but other than that they can both be pretty different in the type of foods that they're serving per day. I think overall
38:16
it's probably the same throughout the school year, just not like the same on each day. But another thing that I
38:23
really like that they do is every now and then they have like kind of a stand they set up, I guess, with just like a
38:30
different cultures food or something different that we could try. Um, I think one time uh Mr. Bloom and Donahghue had
38:37
a barbecue contest where they like Oh, here it goes. Would you like to share
38:42
the results of that contest? I think we can move on. That's fine. One
38:48
of them was normal barbecue and the other one was spicy, right? Was yours the spicy one? I like Mr. John Hughes.
38:53
I'm sorry. That's great. You would be in what we call the losing column at the end. Listen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
39:03
I know. But choose better. No, I I want to thank these two because I think they are excellent role model of um the
39:11
inquiry, right? To come to a wellness meeting three times during activity seasons or poor weather speaks a lot to
39:17
their character. Um, I would say for students that might be listening or parents that are listening, we want more
39:22
student representation and so we'll continue to seek that out next year. But, um, I do want to thank Nancy and
39:28
Shaylee, too, and all of your support with the board policy. Um, do you have any questions for us or things that you
39:36
I don't have any questions. I just want to thank you both for coming to speak to us tonight and thank you for participating in this committee
39:42
because like it is really important to hear student voices. So, thank you. Exactly. I think that five minute break
39:48
is a really good idea because it's hard for anybody to pay attention for an hour and a half and especially if you're
39:53
someone that has trouble focusing for long periods of time like that can really like you might tune out that last
39:58
45 minutes because you're just your mind can't take it, you know, just needs a break. And some of that does show itself
40:05
in our early childhood classes where they may be on an iPad for 40 minutes. It's well-intentioned. They're away from
40:11
the teacher. We need them working on something. but also that demand on your eyes and the brain. The cognitive people
40:17
need that break. It we know uh from research that breaks reduce behavior incences. They allow people a chance to
40:23
get tuned back into the focus. So, um I I think what what you'll see is buildings taking a hard look at what
40:29
they're doing and even if they score low, it's just a springboard for what can we continue to do.
40:37
I was reiterating what they said, but yeah, thank you for being on that committee. I've actually found it very
40:42
insightful, especially more from your guys' point of view because I think sometimes we don't hear that, especially here um at at the board table. So, thank
40:50
you for doing that and being involved with that. Appreciate it. They asked to be here tonight. That's pretty
40:55
remarkable. So, I think the recess time for elementary is important, too, like you brought up. I would like try to add
41:00
I'm all for adding more of that because kids are on the screen so much before and after school. At least if they're out for recess, they're going to have to
41:06
play and not, you know, not be on a device, right? They can't have. So, and I think that will drive, to be honest
41:12
with you, Nick, that'll drive some conversation at the district level about staffing and what that looks like and
41:18
how do we ensure that what's what's um by age level. Can a fourth grader do some things differently than a
41:23
kindergartener? Those are all potentials, but I do know that you guys have asked before, how do we support this work? Um, just know that some of
41:30
those questions may be coming our way, but we know it's it's right and good for kids. So,
41:36
you're done. You did it. Awesome. Thank you. I'm gonna give a round of Nice job. Yeah. Thank you. Yes. Thanks for being
41:42
here so much. Okay. Thank you, Dr. Prrenz. Dr. Bloom. I made
41:48
the Buffalo sauce and it was superior than barbecue sauce, let alone who made
41:54
it, Travis Donahghue. Want to give a quick shout out. Thanks to the wellness team. That that group is awesome. Our
42:00
kids are amazing. And then to decap for I mean honest a couple years ago was borderline non-existent. So to get it
42:07
where it is now is a huge lift. Um at the same time as they were kind of talking about plants and you know some
42:14
of the work we're doing at wellness uh I want to give a shout out to Mark Toms in our local Earl May who Joan partnered
42:21
with to uh he came in and donated his his time and resources to beautify all
42:27
the outdoor space at Oakview in kind of the uh that middle area. So, if you are ever in there and take a look, that is
42:34
kids having a drive and passion to make that place look awesome. And uh Mr. Mark
42:39
Tom's the manager up there again just out of the goodness of his heart going over there is teaching kids about what
42:45
plants you plant here and why donating the again the time and resources. So, super cool. Um okay, my list team, let's
42:53
start with permits. We are uh seven this last month. Six permits were were
43:00
grabbed in Grimes, one in Dallas Center. Um, want to share with this team that
43:06
excited that next month's board meeting, the 19th, we will have uh at least one
43:11
representative from both the cities of Dallas Center and Grimes, they're going to come present to us and just kind of
43:17
talk about upcoming projects, uh maybe some growth plans, just kind of what what their, you know, communities are
43:23
seeing and that kind of relationship and partnership. So excited, uh, connected with both of them. So we'll see them on
43:29
the 19th. We will also have our presentation from RSP who will will talk
43:34
about the latest kind of projections and demographics. So it'll be good timing to have um kind of those three all speak at
43:42
the next board meeting. So um let's talk about district facilities.
43:48
So uh OPN remember is doing two neat things for us. Uh one is kind of working
43:54
on that prioritization. they should have that done in the next couple months where they're really taking a deep dive
43:59
and making those priorities and kind of high level facilities needs um all the way down to you know would be nice but
44:05
something to keep on your radar. So that'll be something that comes out that I tackle uh with the operations
44:12
department but that'll be a big lift for us moving forward. And then the other thing is they're they're kind of working
44:18
the kind of the bond, you know, what what are some high high level work that
44:23
needs to be done around here kind of in conjunction with that. So our last meeting a few weeks ago, um they really
44:29
got feedback from that committee and shared some extremely extremely high level what what potentially some work
44:36
around DCE at kind of a security at the front there could look like. uh a little
44:41
bit more in depth at the middle school and then of course a a significant amount of work that will be needed at
44:47
the high school for lots of so again high level just kind of um talking about
44:52
very very basic options so we'll we'll meet in two weeks again and just kind of keep uh moving that timeline forward but
45:00
that's the facility update I'll have a little bit more to share when I kind of talk SSA here in a second uh enrollment
45:06
we are down seven students from last month 21 students moved out of our
45:12
district and 14 moved in. Um, so that's where you get the seven. From October
45:18
1st, we are down in resident students. We're down a total of 33 since October
45:23
1st. And I want to bring your attention, as you probably reviewed before this meeting, but uh, as of uh, end of last
45:31
week, we are currently down 54 students from registration at this point last
45:37
year. So for our family members watching at home, we we on October 1st, 3576 was
45:44
the total number at this time. 3522 is where we're at. That is a minus
45:51
54. That number does include 35 brand new open enrolled students to DCG. So
45:59
that's not counting the ones that are our regular open enrollment. Right? If you've been open and enrolling at DCG
46:04
for years, you're still technically open enrolled, but we just move you on. So that's 35 new ones, which is exciting,
46:12
but that's still a minus 54. So again, there's your updated numbers, but but
46:18
certainly work to be done and hopefully we just keep keep moving the needle of our own people. Please register if you
46:24
haven't. Please register if you haven't. Kristen does an amazing job up front helping people if they want to do it in
46:29
person. Diana and Deetta can walk you through it over the phone. So, people here ready to take good care of you if
46:36
you have any registration questions. Strategic planning, you guys got to hang out a few weeks ago with
46:41
Julie and do that work session. That next morning, she hung out with um the strategic planning team as well as all
46:47
building uh uh principles, all district leaders, uh directors, and building
46:53
leadership teams. Couple representatives from those. And really what that work over the la over those three hours
46:59
focused in on is really starting to hammer in on the strategic plan. And we
47:05
went for about a good solid hour of kind of a practice run of an action card. So
47:11
if eventually it makes it to the strategic plan that you all will approve most likely in
47:17
July, then it's going to get an action card. Right? If we're if we're going to acknowledge that it's going to be a task
47:23
that we want to do work in, what are the steps we're actually going to do to get that accomplished? Who's going to own
47:29
that work? Who are the teams that will be involved? So, we did a highle kind of practice one with the group because some
47:35
of that will be me, some will be Greg director level, some will be run by building principles. So, we all together
47:42
kind of did this practice run. So, we will meet with Julie as a senior leadership team and as principles
47:50
um kind of by the end of the the month of May. Then we'll have kind of a work session again with you all to kind of
47:55
walk through some of the final governance pieces and hopefully in July we are signing off on that thing and and
48:02
off and running. So, and jump in here with any questions as I'm going through any of
48:08
these. All right, SSA, if you're on the agenda and want to just kind of look at this with me, this is just some hard
48:14
facts and figures. Obviously, um we are disappointed with the 2% SSA.
48:20
Well, like we do, we will make the the best of anything. So, it's not a it's not a signed thing yet, but it's it's at
48:26
the governor's desk right now. Um but with 2% SSA, that's an additional
48:31
62.7 million in new money to the state. That's about 157 additional dollars per
48:38
student. I think an interesting number, kind of a disappointing number, is that puts 157 school districts in Iowa in
48:46
budget guarantee. That means they are making less than they made last last year even with that 2%. So that is a
48:53
again when a place like Dallas or Grimes is in budget guarantee that's a big enough deal in
48:58
its own right, let alone 156 others. Um, some things again from me what I always
49:04
try to do is is be balanced and and open and honest each way. There are some, you know, some neat things in here. 5%
49:10
increase in transportation that will provide 197 districts some extra
49:15
funding. Right now, it doesn't look like that will help us in additional funding, but good for those that are able to
49:22
receive it. $5 toward district cost for people equity. Um so there's going to be
49:28
uh you know a a little bit of what their hope is is investing in um
49:36
differential overtime that is going to be kind of squeezed in. We'll see where
49:41
that piece really goes and how much that affects DCG. Um operational sharing. So these are school districts, right, that
49:47
share positions. Maybe they share superintendent, a business manager, an HR person. So you kind of get a a total
49:55
number for which position you share. They're going to move that from 21 to 25. So that's going to, you know, reward
50:02
folks that that share positions across district right now. That really there's some there's some items in there,
50:07
Michelle, as I think about would impact us. But I mean, we don't have a bunch of shared positions across
50:13
district, but we receive operational sharing for SRO. Thank you. Yep. The SRO would be um our
50:21
piece of that. So again, that's a good thing. You can see the breakdown in numbers of how 2% SSA in terms of um
50:31
regular programs, special ed, our AAS, um those type things and how how the math works out for the district.
50:38
So why I'm talking about that, Ryan, if you'll do me a favor, I'm going to send this to you. I just wanted you guys
50:44
there's a lot here. So I just I got this updated this this morning with Michelle and
50:49
Piper Jeffrey. So thank you Shane. You pass that maybe to Greg and AJ and
50:56
Gary. So I want to spend just a couple of minutes talking with with around SSA
51:02
around legislation and just some of the challenges that are still in front of us.
51:08
Um I first as of the end of last week wanted to share that there are 26
51:14
current education bills that are still out there. They have they are survived and well they are still being discussed
51:22
and could potentially become law by the end of the session. That's 26. 17 bills
51:28
related to education are currently in front of the governor. So she, you know, most likely uh will sign these bills. So
51:34
there's 26 out there. 17 potentially could sign sign that we'll deal with. And I just found this number to be
51:40
fascinating. I don't know if it was good or bad, but just more of a this is what we deal with
51:46
with our friends down there. There are 94 education related bills that were
51:51
started and are now dead. So, at one point, in addition to the numbers
51:57
already shared, there were 94 other ones out there that people thought would be
52:02
helpful to education for good, bad, or indifferent. But I just thought that that's a lot out there where we as
52:09
public schools got to continue to advocate for oursel and be in the loop. And most importantly, I think I've
52:14
shared before they don't like hearing from me. They want to hear from you and they want to hear from our families.
52:20
Like superintendent, the Gregs of the world, the Michelle's of the we all kind of say the same thing, Adam. They want
52:27
if it's going to impact mom and dad, they're going to listen a little bit more. So, this is another round of our hope that we we hope we get
52:33
advocacy from our parents with some of these things because I think that will really move the needle. And that brings
52:39
me to the document I shared with you. Um, there is currently a couple bills
52:44
out there that will potentially have major property tax reform. And I won't go line by line, but the gist of this is
52:51
there's probably a little bit of a cell. And I'm going to be the first to admit Michelle and I are not experts in this.
52:57
This is about as complex of a bill as as as is out there in a long time. So, superintendent meetings, uh, we've tried
53:04
our best. We've got ISB helping us out, SAI helping us out, and now, um, our
53:10
friends at Piper are incredibly bright. They help us with our bonding and all that stuff. This is their work with us
53:15
to try to help coach us up. So, it's very complex. So, we're not experts, but we think we've got a pretty good handle on some big ticket items. Um, I think
53:24
the the the summary that I want to share is there's probably a selling point that
53:30
residential, like we really want to help the taxpayer, right? Our taxes go to a lot of things for property taxes. And I
53:36
think that's fair. No one would argue that. But I think there's probably a misnomer out there with current legislation that if this property tax
53:42
bill passed that you, the property tax residential homeowner, would see some
53:48
sign significant difference. That is not the case. the difference is going to go to people with land and with people with
53:54
businesses, commercial, they will see the biggest um kind of help. There is
53:59
certainly a portion of this bill that actually increases some property tax concerns to the regular homeowner based
54:05
on dollars and cents of your house. To be frank, if you're making a if your house is in that
54:12
$150,000ish range, you're probably going to see some property tax relief. If your house gets much over
54:17
$150,000, you're probably paying more. And I think we've got uh again, to try
54:24
to be just honest and inappropriate, I I think we're kind of lumping, if you hear it in the news, property tax relief
54:30
sounds pretty. It's not really to mom and dad owning owning a home. It's a lot of other places. So, here's some major
54:37
concerns that we have with this bill and where we need your advocacy and our family's advocacy. our families uh what
54:43
couple months ago just went to the polls and overwhelmingly supported our increase in ple overwhelmingly upwards
54:49
of 90%. With this bill our school foundation levy will be reduced in half.
54:55
So our debt service levy and our ple dollars will be cut in half. So to just
55:01
skip to kind of the big numbers today, our valuation of of our
55:06
property tax dollars that go to passing bonds, which we all know is completely necessary for our high school campus,
55:14
for the middle school needs attention. DCE, we have lots of needs both with
55:19
bond and ple today. That number would be $66 million that we could bond for. That
55:25
would do a great number of things for DCG. If the property tax bill goes through as it is written today, that
55:31
number will be cut in half. We would go from a $66 million bond in November to
55:36
$33 million bond. To be honest, I'm probably coming to you and say it's I'm
55:42
not sure it's worth our time because of what we we would be bandating the heck out of this place instead of really
55:48
having a vision. So, that's scary. Pebble would be cut in half. So we would
55:53
lose every single year for the next 23 years just under $1 million in PPE. So
56:00
think of the things we can't do through a bond. We get to do every year for PPE. And we share out through AJ's tremendous
56:07
communication. This is how we pay for buses. This is how we get furniture, right? This is how we fix the HVAC
56:13
system. This is how we put roofs on our buildings. This is how our kids get oneonone computers in their hands. We
56:19
don't take it out of general ed fund because we're paying teachers the salaries and benefits they deserve. This
56:25
comes over here. They're going to cut that in half. We have nowhere but to go to general ed funding. Otherwise, we're
56:32
going to say like deal with the roof issue. Maybe we don't need a onetoone laptop program. No, we're not doing new
56:39
furniture, updated furniture because we have to. We don't want these conversations. So again, to you and to
56:46
our families at home if this property tax bill goes through, you're not going to see a
56:52
residential gain like maybe is being perceived and the district will get less
56:58
of your property tax dollars. And I think an important thing to share if folks, if you kind of have it in red, um
57:05
$150,000 house, your tax burden is going to decline by 15%. Like great, you get
57:11
tax relief. That's awesome. For a $400,000 house, you're going to pay 3.5%
57:17
more in property taxes more. And I just told you half of that now is going to
57:24
come to the schools, which means more of your money is going to go to the state, not to the school with your property
57:30
tax. And the state as part of this law is going to say, "Hey, we're going to
57:36
give you less property tax problems because we're going to come in and supplement your school districts. Trust
57:42
us, right? Wherever they're at, we're going to maintain that for them." So, you get the relief and we'll we'll pick
57:50
up more of the burden. No disrespect to our folks downtown. that hasn't been
57:55
widely wellreceived with current evidence of how they're willing to pick up the burden of public education. So
58:02
mom and dads in Dallas Center and Grimes are actually going to pay more property tax on a residential if their house, you
58:08
know, gets over that roughly $200,000 mark and less of that money will actually go to your instate your your in
58:15
district schools. That is a significant concern we believe for not only the homeowner but of course for the district
58:23
who believes in their people when they vote at 90% to allow us to use this
58:28
money rightfully in law and now they're going to come in and cut it by half. That will have major detriment to DCG.
58:36
So Michelle's been amazing at this. Again, um we've talked with Piper about
58:41
getting them in front of you in the near future if we think that would be important to have some more of the experts come in and share this. These
58:48
are the folks again that we do some bonding with. So, I may be texting or emailing in the very near near future of
58:55
of getting them in front of us at a quick time so we can still advocate for this. Um but just wanted our public that
59:02
watches to hear that have you have kind of a cheat sheet of advocacy. Um, and with that, I'll do my best with
59:08
questions before I go on to the last part of my spiel, but Michelle, any anything to add that maybe I missed
59:14
that's important? Uh, I just want to clarify when you said, uh, Pepple would lose a million dollars, that's a million
59:20
dollars per year. Thank you. Yep. And then um with the assumptions that were made in the model that we reviewed with
59:27
Piper, I just want to point out that um current assumptions show a property
59:33
tax u valuation shift. Um valuations
59:38
moving from 52 to almost 65% for residential. A landladen buildings
59:44
moving from 17 to 11. So egg land and buildings going down, residential going
59:51
up, and commercial and industrial declining from about 25% to
59:58
19.5%. And so there is definitely a shift. Yep. Thank you, Michelle.
1:00:06
And this is what we would generally categorize as the management fund, right?
1:00:12
No. No. Uh there there is legislation relating to the management fund which caps the ability to levy uh based on
1:00:21
fund balance. What we're reviewing here is just property tax property tax the
1:00:27
restructuring of what I have taught you is the basic combined district cost bullet uh bucket and then also the ple
1:00:35
bucket and the debt service bucket. this will severely impa impede your ability
1:00:42
to capital funding. I just asked because we get a lot of
1:00:47
emails from IASB and they're calling for a lot of advocacy and legislative action
1:00:52
from school board members. Yep. Um and so I've seen a lot about management fund
1:00:58
in addition to property tax. So should both of these proposed legislation go
1:01:04
through um the impact on Dallas Center Grimes would be Yeah. would be tremendous. The
1:01:12
impact on schools statewide. Absolutely. Yep.
1:01:19
Okay. Thanks team. Last thing I want to I hope that wasn't too downer. Just just facts and appreciate your advocacy of
1:01:25
DCG and public schools. But the last thing I want to share is so we had that um strategic planning with you all then
1:01:31
the and the team that next morning like I said well uh senior leadership team this last Monday a week ago got together
1:01:38
and spent the day together at the Grimes Public Library and the great majority of
1:01:43
the time was really going after that strategic plan starting to focus on what could come next year, two years, three
1:01:50
years really doing our priority matrix on all of those things. So that was really exciting to help us build kind of
1:01:56
our our goals and and as we call them those big rocks for next year and beyond. But the first hour and a half or
1:02:01
so was really our reflection together. And I just wanted to highlight because of what I what I think of them and the
1:02:07
leaders that we have in this district at all levels. Again I I shared this in the board packet. I won't read the whole
1:02:13
thing, but please, you know, for our families listening and and for you all,
1:02:18
there is so much that just from their department, we we would be here for hours if we talked about each building
1:02:24
and every classroom and all the great things that were accomplished. But, you know, Greg overseeing our school
1:02:30
improvement when we talk about our f first full year of all the bullying and harassment process and all the kids
1:02:36
we've been in front of and all the coaches and all the bus drivers and all the sponsors, right? IsASP has been an
1:02:42
incredible we you just heard from DECAP and wellness, our TQ team. Uh it was,
1:02:48
you know, for the most part a pretty darn successful change in the calendar and all the professional development that we
1:02:54
got to every single staff member in this district regardless of of what position
1:02:59
you hold. Um our civil rights data, we are taking off on our MTSSB work. So, you know, we're we're
1:03:06
getting consistent with how we do our MTSS process districtwide at every
1:03:11
building strategic plan. Um, we're we've got a new found focus for all of our CTE
1:03:16
programs. And how do we do that? So, um, Greg was magical with our AA. I think we
1:03:22
got the exact same amount of service from the awesome people at the AEA and were able to do some other things um
1:03:29
with him that we even may not have been able to do the year before. So, awesome stuff there. Uh Shana's kicking it out
1:03:36
of the park with all the curriculum, guaranteed envirable. She's going through a process now. Uh we've had
1:03:41
elementary report cards that are getting kind of redone with with great feedback from elementary staff. Um instructional
1:03:48
coaches, curriculum facilitators, kind of that group that she oversees in the TLC world are just doing things that
1:03:55
have never been done at DCG before. So I want to highlight her. We're going to miss Rocks big time, but are excited
1:04:00
about Ally who's joining us and just all the special education transformation
1:04:06
that's been done. Our counselors have been tremendous with our 504 process. You saw the work from TAG and ELLL. Like
1:04:14
these these groups are getting the attention they deserve and doing some really neat things. So, student services
1:04:19
is a beast on its own. And just to see Rock celebrate all the neat things that have gone in there. brand new HR
1:04:26
director. Carrie's been a home run for us. Right. Again, the the number of things that I kind of see in a in a day
1:04:32
and a week where Carrie gets to be on a phone or have a meeting that I remember last year, Greg, Michelle and I looked
1:04:38
at each other went, "Okay, who's free?" Right? Who who's going to tackle this one right now? And Carrie just doing
1:04:44
that for us, but also he's he's our PD for associates. Jamie and and Carrie are
1:04:50
cleaning up all of our job descriptions. are getting frontline uh digital evaluations off and running. All of our
1:04:56
trainings for every single staff member starting uh the end of this month is moving completely online. So, our
1:05:02
teachers don't have to grab 12 different websites to figure out what their trainings are. They get to go to one
1:05:08
spot. Um our hiring protocols are getting cleaned up, our processes are getting cleaned up. Chapter 102, he's
1:05:14
done several investigations there. So, just proud of the work there. And then AJ um you know to be able to tell people
1:05:20
21 different languages parent square um I bet you I hear the most compliments
1:05:27
about parent square from people that I'm out and about and I've had no less than
1:05:32
eight conversations with superintendent that are just hearing about parent square that get you know hey we don't
1:05:38
have it but should we? So really proud of that $1.3 million view uh million
1:05:43
views. You know, I would love for our board and families to keep sharing that, right? Keep keep hitting keep hitting uh
1:05:50
forward on those. Keep hitting share like the positive news about DCG is
1:05:56
everywhere. So keep spreading all that positive news. Uh you you know about the high school boards, the partnership with
1:06:02
Rack Valley Bank is great. brand new activities website, brand new uh regular
1:06:07
district website coming out soon, communication plan, our social media plan. AJ's been great with our peple and
1:06:14
bond the I mean it goes on and on. But again, that's a celebration of them, but more importantly the people that work
1:06:20
with them and I just wanted our board and families to hear like in 30 minutes
1:06:25
hopefully I rattled off a few successes that are going on in the district and there's a million more in each one of
1:06:31
our buildings and every one of our classrooms. But you as the the leaders of our district should be very proud of
1:06:37
this senior leadership team and everyone that they get to work with every day because they are doing big things for
1:06:43
for teachers and kids. So with that, Ryan, I think I'm good, but I'll take any questions if they're
1:06:48
out there. Thanks a bunch for sharing that. There's a million good things going on and we
1:06:55
don't always slow down enough to focus on those for Thanks. So thanks for pulling that together, Miss Wermouth.
1:07:02
Taking a look at the revenue and expenditure summary for the close of the month of April, you'll find us at
1:07:09
71.3% of the appropriations for expenditures. And for revenue, you'll
1:07:15
find us at 82%. A big change there is that we have 90% uh 96% of property taxes received as
1:07:23
of the close of this month as we move forward to close out our fiscal year.
1:07:29
Um, taking a look next at the public budget comparison report. This is the
1:07:34
report that compares what you published in the newspaper last year as you certified the FY25 budget. Looking in
1:07:41
the four specific areas, uh, you'll see that we're at 65% of both instruction
1:07:48
and 62% of support services. Um, that's right in line with where we were last
1:07:53
year. Non-instructional programs would be the food service program. We're at 40% of appropriation this year and that
1:08:01
is uh a little bit below where we were at this point last year. I believe
1:08:06
that's the change in um our type of a method of contract for our food service
1:08:14
program and don't expect that to exceed and finally 20% in our other
1:08:19
expenditures or bond principle and interest areas and construction areas. Uh, I am not recommending an amendment
1:08:26
to the FY25 budget as we review this data. Do you have any questions there?
1:08:34
Two years in a row. Good job, Michelle. Um, finally, uh, discussion of committed
1:08:42
fund balance. If you recall um in the past, we move a uh set amount from the
1:08:50
uncommitted line in our audit to the committed line, giving a better reflection of what we intend to do in
1:08:58
the upcoming fiscal year. Typically, we look at unusual items um that might be
1:09:04
costing the district in a specific year, additional staffing items, and then curriculum cycle was added last year. In
1:09:12
the past year, uh, our committed fund balance was $996,000. This year, I'm recommending a
1:09:19
much lower amount at $545,000 being moved into the committed
1:09:24
fund balance. This reflects um 145,000 in new staffing requests in the upcoming
1:09:32
year, Spanish at the secondary level, and room for one elementary expansion,
1:09:38
and then uh $400,000 uh for the curriculum cycle.
1:09:43
Next year, the curriculum cycle is music and math. Uh Greg did prepare the
1:09:48
document that appears in this section. Is there anything you'd like to add, Dr. Corenza?
1:09:55
No, I think thank you for allowing us a chance. I think what I would just call your attention to are kind of the left
1:10:01
or the right two columns just I think there's a lot that people don't always consider. They consider the initial
1:10:07
purchase. U but Michelle's been really great because helping us delineate what are I mean there's online subscriptions
1:10:14
there's consumables non-consumables. It's a massive lift and then you have uh like books renewal
1:10:20
textbooks things like that. I just like to illustrate when people ask it's not just the actual I mean we say curriculum
1:10:28
or curriculum resource there's a lot to that purchase that traditionally I mean
1:10:33
can be very very expensive but needed to to run the programs.
1:10:44
Thank you very much. Any questions? All right. I'll move us along
1:10:50
to new business. Um, we've got item A, the first reading of listed policies.
1:10:55
We've got a four, five, six, and 700 series policy for you to
1:11:01
review. Looking for a motion. Move to approve. Dickinson.

project 2025. Looking for a motion. Move to approve. Menberg second. Viella. Any
1:11:57
discussion? When was the roof last replaced? Just
1:12:05
Good question. Uh that building was built in 1999. It has had some updates
1:12:12
and repairs but never a full roof. Right. And the expected not being in the
1:12:17
construction field, the expected longevity of I mean obviously this is a big expenditure. I would anticipate
1:12:24
that. But how long we could we expect a roof replacement to last? It's a great you're you're more of an expert. I feel
1:12:30
it's got to be 20 plus. Yeah. We we always forecast in 20 years and then give them a health check and sometimes
1:12:36
and obviously we have crazy weather and there are things that have to be repaired. I'm just general public. Yeah,
1:12:42
I think this is a good example of that. I mean if it's you know 26 years old and you know with some care and feeding they
1:12:50
got an additional six years out of it. So but yeah 20 is kind of that. Yeah. And flat rooms are harder than I'm just
1:12:58
thinking like a stakeholder. Yep. Hey, well I have a question, but the um it's
1:13:03
more more my husband. Just kidding. Um so we're going down to insulation on that roof, right? I think we're taking
1:13:08
everything away down to insulation. Do what what happens if any of that insulation is bad? That's not really in that contract, correct? Is that typical?
1:13:15
Yeah, I mean it's it's it's rigid foam or ISO. So I mean they'll they'll I
1:13:22
would imagine there's a small contingency on here of uh maybe not. Michelle, do we usually carry a
1:13:27
contingency or not on these projects? There there is a small amount set aside. Okay. So they would just if something
1:13:34
looks bad in this section or whatever they would okay replace that. Okay.

1:17:48
Second.
1:17:53
Any discussion? I have a few questions. Um, how did we arrive at $115,000 for the salary? Yeah,
1:18:00
let's this is one of those where you you just kind of go to the market, Meg, and you you do your best to see where other
1:18:06
school districts are. Um, this is a unique one where you're kind of looking at private a little bit. And I shared
1:18:13
earlier like we tried to get an HVAC assistant to come in and that was just
1:18:18
rough for us. So looking at where we where we were at where Travis was at but
1:18:23
but taking on a different leadership role just looking at the market and how do we keep our people but also justify
1:18:30
it compared to our friends around us in similar positions. So looking at what we
1:18:36
currently pay for the director and then the assistant director for these positions that we have and understanding
1:18:42
that we are moving into this new siloed effect. Um there's a difference of about
1:18:47
$28,000 $28,495 just for a difference in salaries and that seems like a really
1:18:53
significant ask based on what we've just listened to in the way of enrollment and taxes and state things and local things.
1:19:00
Y um and so I understand the justification and I understand the necessity here, but I do want to raise
1:19:07
the question as to whether or not this is exactly the right time to be making changes to the tune of approximately
1:19:14
$30,000 when we are already down in enrollment 54 students from last year. We don't
1:19:21
know what that's going to look like in a month or two. We are down in SSA. We are
1:19:27
operating off of the credit card, right? That's what we've been told. Um, and additionally, uh, what we've been paying
1:19:34
the person in this director role who has 18 years of experience doing this job.
1:19:40
Um, and as far as I understand, Mr. Donahghue might be really great, but he has never done this job before. So,
1:19:47
paying top tier dollars for lack of experience seems like a really big ask
1:19:52
from the district also. So, I'm wondering if you could shed some light on that. Yeah. Um, great great points
1:19:58
and great questions. Again, I I would share that, you know, sometimes in administrative positions, it's not
1:20:04
a, you know, this what I always say when it comes to administrators, you're not always recouping money like sometimes
1:20:09
you do with teachers in retirement. Like we may hire a high school principal that
1:20:14
makes more than the current high school principal. That's a little bit of the market. That's a little bit of where people come from. So, in this case, you
1:20:23
know, I'm I'm not going to go into the what do other people make and why, you know, part of that, but I certainly
1:20:29
think you're talking about seven school buildings, transportation department, but I mean, we're a pretty goodiz
1:20:37
business and to have two people running a pretty goodiz business when you talk about all the preventative uh
1:20:45
maintenance that needs, all the fixes that need to be, upcoming bond schedule. So like a big part of Travis's role,
1:20:50
which is really neat from his leadership as a school leader is now here comes the bond where we hope to put millions of
1:20:57
dollars over the next three plus years. Travis is going to be the guy that gets to sit in the room with DCI, OPN, and
1:21:03
all of our people to talk school with them. Very few districts have that luxury where they're one of their
1:21:09
directors and operations is a school person. So looking at his resume, the
1:21:16
talents he brings, the you know he's been in the district for 20 plus years and then
1:21:21
marketing what an operations person makes, we felt like these two leaders as co-directors that is is very much a a
1:21:29
fair number. And I I appreciate I did take into account like okay what are our ads? Spanish teacher. Our ads are
1:21:36
another section at DC Elementary and and certainly this is a dollars and cents
1:21:42
ad. Took all that account and I promise you I wouldn't bring you these dollars and cents if they didn't have real value
1:21:48
and we we couldn't afford them. Is there any um is there any possibility that
1:21:53
since we are going to be spending this additional money on salaries then um that these
1:22:00
two entities then will also take up snow removal. The reason I ask is uh in
1:22:06
looking through bills that we have paid from January to today um the district has
1:22:13
spent $38,115 on snow removal this year alone in 2025.
1:22:20
Um, and I'm curious if perhaps keeping that in-house then is a way to offset
1:22:26
some of these costs. Yeah, it's a good question. I would say on the surface probably not with all of the our
1:22:33
in-house people do, you know, all of the sidewalks. They like Sean comes and kind of helps coat all of the stuff on all
1:22:39
the building. So, we do a lot of internal things, but we do hire out the we need it removed by this time. We just
1:22:47
don't have the personnel andor the the trucks, right? The large equipment. Yeah. They just outside have that. What
1:22:54
we did do for this year um with with um Sean's leadership is we actually brought
1:23:00
all of our mowing services in house. So that was I can't remember off the top of my head, but about 15 20 25,000
1:23:08
somewhere in their savings to have our own people do all the mowing. We used to contract out with R.J. Okay. So, we
1:23:14
thought, well, there's a little savings there that snow removal is the one that some years it's up, some years it's
1:23:20
down. So, I don't see a lot of big changes with the snow removal with with these positions. Just the continued
1:23:27
hopefully increase increase in process and oversight and safety that I believe these guys will bring. They are also
1:23:33
doing ice melt, but during that period of time that snow removal is occurring, they are using our own vehicles and
1:23:39
doing ice melt applications. Yeah. Okay. So, but I appreciate the questions.
1:23:45
Any other discussion? And I don't they're not like per say doing actual work. They're more like coordinating like HVAC repair, right? And electrical
1:23:52
like it's Yep. So, in between in between that maybe hire other people in these
1:23:58
positions to work below these. Yeah, we we've got a couple awesome folks in
1:24:03
house, but we can't get any more. So right now Sean in a director level position is still the guy a lot of times
1:24:11
going in to fix the HVAC stuff. We don't okay we do the best we can of keeping it
1:24:17
in house and not going out of house. So not only is like we've got to clean up
1:24:22
efficiency. We've got we don't have all of our think about all of the items
1:24:28
within a building like all those aren't even marked and have a proactive tag of what's our maintenance years and how
1:24:33
often like we don't have a software that does a great job of that. They're going to clean that up. So he's going to have
1:24:39
kind of the HVAC mechanical side traffic. So I have kind of the building and ground side again with oversight of
1:24:45
how do we onboard do a better job of onboarding our custodians, right? How do we do a better job of when people are
1:24:50
using our buildings that we've got ways to make sure it's operating better? I just I'm excited
1:24:55
about their leader. I like we're doing really good. I'm excited about what I think will come. I think it's all Yeah,
1:25:01
I think it's all good to people. I just don't know if we need to like add more people below that because like we hired we have the HVAC. Yeah. Uh we just hired
1:25:07
that maintenance that plane we we paid quite a bit of money for which is good. Yep. That will help. That should help
1:25:12
lessen the maintenance. Yeah. I would still I would still love like a missing piece right now is an HVAC technician.
1:25:20
So again, Sean's not the one that goes and fixes everything and we're still probably a couple of custodians behind
1:25:27
in terms of just building space. So I would obviously from a staffing side that's a few that we're missing, but
1:25:34
otherwise a lot of it is process efficiency, proactive measures, those types of things that I think will come.
1:25:42
Is there a way I'm sorry I am on my penny pinchion like purse strings are
1:25:47
tightened up soap box today. Is there some sort of like um consulting firm
1:25:54
that can come in and help streamline these things for like a one-time cost and not an annual $115,000 plus full benefits. Like
1:26:02
something that comes in helps streamline a process if you've got somebody that's the liaison between the the people who
1:26:08
are doing the work and then the district itself. like I understand that this is an important role and but again is this
1:26:16
absolutely the best time to be making these kinds of financial decisions. We had a very very similar conversation
1:26:22
last year when we brought on Carrie. I don't disagree that this is a very important position that the district and
1:26:28
a district this side need size needs. But I think there's something to be said for bringing in people who have
1:26:36
if we insist that this isn't a necessary expenditure then there should be no harm
1:26:42
in opening this up to people who might have experience like did we post this
1:26:48
post Travis Donnie who has experience me like as being a director stop
1:26:53
discrediting his service in construction and building and grounds has he had this position at a district before he is not
1:27:01
no he's got industrial tech teaching background but we did post we did post just like any other position yes so so
1:27:07
back to your your question about consulting I would say remember we have two people in that
1:27:14
position already so there are two staff members director and assistant right now and Sean got kind of a we
1:27:22
we we made money to be frank on Shawn this year with his current contract because he was hourly so he was making
1:27:28
well above his current salary and hourly overtime wages. So, we kind of did us a solid and we did him a solid. So, this
1:27:34
is making two equal directors the same. But I think where I would say your consulting thing is obviously a great
1:27:40
idea, but we're talking about a difference there of $28,000 that you mentioned. Like for our in-house people,
1:27:47
if we agree that we need both humans, I'm not sure there's a consulting firm
1:27:52
out there that gets us the bang for our buck for the $28,000 addition that we're paying these
1:27:58
two. Oh, no. My thinking was that we would limp along on one position for as
1:28:03
long as it takes to get back in. Okay, I appreciate that. I personally I think that would be a to what I see now every
1:28:09
day that would be a huge disservice to DCG to put a operations department as a
1:28:15
oneperson job. That would be very harmful to us. Okay. Yep. Thank you. You

kind of do the math that like in in Car's case, Carrie, what number are you at on there? 10. 10. Yeah. So, it's 10
1:31:24
