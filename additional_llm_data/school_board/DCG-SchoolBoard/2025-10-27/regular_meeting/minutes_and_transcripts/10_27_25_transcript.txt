B, math stars recognition. Dr. Bloom.
2:29
All right. Good evening. We've got some celebrities in the house. It is not the kindergarten team from South Prairie. I
2:35
want them to be humble. You're great. You're great. But we've got fourth grade
2:40
rock stars here. So, be humble today. No. Um, it's my pleasure. We We need to
2:46
do this stuff more often because our kids are doing uh incredible things. But um the department of education reached
2:52
out and they have partnered with what's called the national math stars and they
2:58
are recognizing the top performing math students from across the state on their
3:03
math ISAS scores in third grade. So we have nine students that I'm going to
3:08
announce and and seven or eight of seven or eight of them were able to attend tonight which is great. But these
3:14
students represent the top 2% of third grade students last year. They're
3:20
currently fourth grade students, but third grade students last year and their performance on the ISAS test in math.
3:26
And and this is a recognition because of this national math star um nominee that
3:32
the the state actually sends in. So this is super cool that DCG has nine of the students across the state that are
3:40
recognized. So, for these celebrities, when I say your name, you got to go stand right up there. We're going to
3:46
kind of just make a line. Stand right in front of Monica. She will want to be blocked out because we're going to take
3:52
a picture. So, all right. So, we'll cheer on these folks as they come up. And then I get to give them a cool uh
3:59
medal that should get you discounts at Sky Zone. I would assume it's like, hey,
4:07
teacher, I'm not doing my homework, obviously. I mean, look at the medal, right? I'm kind of a big deal. So, all
4:13
right. Luke Fulker, who I know couldn't make it tonight, but Luke is on the list. Blake Gustoson.
4:21
There's Blake. There he is.
4:28
Just kind of by Monica. And we're going to go straight across. Max Kemp. There's
4:33
Max.
4:38
I'm gonna get your fist bump up there. Quinn Marky. Quinn.
4:44
There she is.
4:49
Jackson Mcnite. Where's Jackson?
4:58
Rowan Miller. Rowan. Yeah.
5:04
Who's that? I said Roma. Yeah, Roma lettuce. No. Rowan right here on my
5:09
list. Is Addison Pelton here? Did Addison make it? I knew she was a maybe.
5:15
Okay. Ellery Snow. Where is Ellery? Yes.
5:25
We need to ask Eller's dad what she thinks of her new boss. We'll talk about that afterward. Okay. Harper Woolworth.
5:33
Harper.
5:39
All right, I'm going to grab some medals. We're going to make this very Olympic official.
5:47
Take a big fancy picture. Okay, ready over your neck. So fancy. There
5:56
you go. There you go, buddy.
6:14
Stay up as late as you want. [Laughter]
6:34
One more time. Nice job, Will. Way to go. Nice job.
6:45
Nice and close. Come on in here. Snuggle up.
6:55
Congratulations.
7:08
Congratulations.
7:15
All right. Congrats. [Applause]
7:23
This meeting will go till like 8:30. You want to stick around? Can I ask one question?
7:28
You bet. How many students are in that pool? 700. Oh, good question. 700, I think.
7:36
764 are in the top 2%. So, whatever the math
7:41
is, total third graders in the state. Great question.
7:48
Congrats again. Awesome job.
7:54
Thank you, Ryan. You bet. One minute here.
8:24
All right, we'll move along to the next item then. Operations department update
8:30
is Travis and Sean. There you are.
8:56
You got to introduce yourself. No. Okay. Um why would I introduce?
9:01
Okay. Um Scott asked us to come. We just have uh there's quite a few things on the agenda from our department. So we
9:07
just wanted to talk about a few of those um just to kind of get out in front of it. And if you have any questions, we'll
9:12
take those as well. You're up first, sir. Okay. Thank you. One of the things that
9:17
we've been doing since uh June is taking inventory of the operations equipment
9:24
and seeing how we use it and utilize it. Um, thank you for letting us purchase a
9:30
John Deere Gator that has helped our custodial department out after Friday night football games. We have a blade
9:37
for it to help with snow removal at the high school, Oak View, and a spreader
9:43
for the back of it to help with snow removal. So, thank you for that. We started looking into two other pieces of
9:50
equipment that we have that are around the vintage of 2003, which be would be
9:58
an S250 skid loader and a John Deere tractor with a handful of attachments.
10:03
And we started looking. We got quotes from Bobcat, John Deere, and Avant for a
10:11
payloader, mini payloader. What we've looked into is the Avant stands out
10:18
above and beyond the rest of them because it is safe on sports turf. We
10:24
can take it on our all- weather track. We can take it on our grass field and it
10:29
will not disrupt it. Um, so we're just kind of looking at that piece of equipment with upgrading from 2003
10:36
equipment to 25, maybe the possibility of taking over some snow removal with
10:44
the purchase of that equipment to save the district line.
10:49
And one of the things is we when looking at the inventory, we have a lot of attachments that just aren't being used
10:56
because we don't we don't have the manpower and we don't to use those back and forth. So, we're looking at having
11:02
one piece of equipment really take the place of two so we can use it more and then get um also in that kind of switch
11:09
out some of our attachments that we haven't been using um for quite a while that have just kind of been sitting idle
11:14
um that have not been in use for us. Um, next we'll talk about Does anyone have any questions about that?
11:26
What do you do with a mini payloader? So, um, you're fine. Nope. So, we have a
11:32
skid. Yeah. So, we have a skid loader that we use for a lot of different things to move around. Um, we also have
11:38
used it for, um, like moving our wood chips and we put wood chips on all the playgrounds. But over the years that
11:43
with that skid loader and what we're doing, we just it doesn't have the capacity that we need. So a mini
11:48
payloader allows us to be able to lift more, be able to telescope out to be able to use the piece of equipment more
11:56
frequently. Um it also allows us to take on some more snow removal because we can
12:02
get a bigger piece of equipment. Um the other nice thing about it that we're really looking forward to is we right
12:07
now don't have a piece of equipment that can go on our um our turf. So, we can do
12:12
anything you can do with the skid loader plus anything we can do with our tractor, we can do with this one piece of equipment. So, we'll take from two to
12:19
one. Perfect. Um, also for these unused attachments, so when you said like
12:24
swapping them out, is this something like these are not universal attachments? I presume, right? So, there
12:30
would be some trading involved or not necessarily the ones that we currently have are not universal with with if we go with the
12:36
Avant, they have a lot of attachments that are universal for that piece of equipment. So every piece of attachment
12:42
that we have right now, we can get for that piece of equipment if we need it. So then we would then like gov deals or
12:49
something the attachments that we do have to offset the cost of the new attachments that would then fit this with the Avant. They will actually trade
12:56
in all the pieces of equipment that we have which was not what it Bobcat or John Deere will not trade those pieces
13:02
of equipment. So then we would have to gov deals with this vendor. They're willing to trade in and take all of that. That's why when you look at it,
13:09
you'll see there's quite a difference in pay because they'll they'll take all those attachments. Beautiful.
13:14
On trade in. Thank you. All right. Next, we'll talk about snow bids.
13:19
So, this year we had a lot of people bid snow. Uh we had seven bid. I bet I
13:26
talked to five or six others on the phone asking questions, which is great.
13:33
They're giving us a really good price. It made it competitive. Um so we got
13:39
three vendors um in the district. Two are new. Um two new ones will be doing
13:45
Dallas Center schools. One will be doing uh Oak View and then uh the existing one
13:52
will be doing the high school uh Northridge and Heritage and South
13:58
Prairie. Any questions on Snow Bit? So, since you
14:05
said that you there are a few pieces of equipment that already exist um that
14:11
would allow you to take on some snow removal. Um what does that look like
14:17
from your end? Yeah. So, we'll kind of right now if we can get a we if we can get a new piece
14:23
of equipment that will allow us to take on some of that. Our first um area that
14:29
we'll take back would be transportation. Right now we have transportation built into our snow bid to like when it comes
14:35
to the high school we would take on that um to be able to do with the fact that we get a new piece of equipment and then
14:40
also we'll talk about in a minute with hiring a general maintenance person to be able to take on some more of that.
14:46
Also with the gator that was purchased when you think about like when we get an
14:51
inch of snow in the middle of the day we can't really get a snow contractor back out here for that. So, we do a lot of
14:56
shoveling of uh the high school complex, this complex, and Opute. That piece of
15:02
equipment with the with the new hire will allow us to then clear all that out and make it safer for our students when
15:08
we get some of that snow in the middle of the day that we can't really justify bringing in a contractor to do.
15:14
Wonderful. Thank you, Travis. Sean, will you take a a second to explain kind of how you break down
15:21
the final cost of the bid because I know on the sheet on the spreadsheet
15:26
some of the numbers may be larger to one company than another, but you don't look at those numbers are like their entire
15:33
fleet versus like what we actually will use. Can you explain how that Yeah. So, so Snow Bid went out just like
15:40
it has for the past however many years. And what we got some feedback on what when when Sean, Michelle, and I sat
15:46
down, looked at it, what we struggled with was some companies put down their whole fleet that would come in and this
15:52
was the X amount for their fleet. Well, if they had 25 trucks, they're not bringing 25 trucks to DCG. That's just
15:59
the size of the fleet that they have. So then what we did is we looked at per piece of equipment what they charged.
16:05
So, we did that breakdown by each vendor and added that up and then went with the vendor that was the the lowest bid for
16:12
that. So, um next year we're we're already have some some notes on that when we put out snow bid for next year
16:18
to clarify some of those things to get some more detailed information. But if you look at the one vendor, I think they
16:25
said their their total fleet was 25 trucks, six skid loaders. Um they're not
16:30
bringing all that here. That's just all the equipment they had. So that's why we've broke it down by those individual
16:36
pieces. Thanks. Um the next thing we want to talk about,
16:41
you'll see on the agenda is we did um post for a general maintenance position. So we've in our department, we had an
16:47
electrician um last year. Um that person no longer works with us. That job has been open for a while. We had it out. Uh
16:54
we kind of shut that electrician position down because we looked at when we looked back at our data, we didn't
16:59
have really a 40hour a week job just for an electrician. Um, so when we look at our needs, we were looking for someone
17:05
who could come in and help us with our work order system that can kind of take on all the different things that are happening. Um, looking for a
17:12
well-rounded individual to do all those tasks and then hoping that this person would then be able to support what we do
17:18
a lot of our summer projects and also help us with that snow removal, um, putting down ice melt, things like that.
17:23
So, we put out for a general maintenance position. Um it was out for two weeks, had a lot of applicants, called,
17:29
interviewed five people um and then um have who we would like to um take that
17:36
position. Um and then the other position that would be new to our department is a night and weekend activities custodian.
17:42
This custodian would support would be housed out of the high school and would support our events that are happening.
17:48
Um, but the big help that this position would have is currently when we have rentals in our facilities, we're using
17:55
our building custodians on overtime or we're not really s having a custodial
18:01
presence there. This person would work over the weekend. So, when we have the community um basketball league at
18:08
Northridge, we would have someone there to open it up, be there during the day to check in, and be there at night to to
18:14
help tear down and clean up so that we're not putting that back on our uh building custodians during the day. So
18:21
they would they would kind of float between all of our buildings looking at like a Friday to Monday or Friday to
18:26
Tuesday depending on how many hours they put in to really support our weekend um events to help support our activities at
18:34
night. And then also um we do building checks every single day. Either at night
18:39
when our night custodians are going through the building or every weekend we have someone come in. This position would take over some of those building
18:45
checks as well. So, we weren't having our daytime custodians come in on the weekend to do building checks, which is
18:51
which is on that overtime pay. So, to kind of help alleviate some of that as well. And and I really appreciate
18:57
Madison and the activities department. We sat down again. Um we have we have done interviews for this, interviewed a
19:03
handful of people and and think we have a candidate uh that we would like. We're just waiting on some of the paperwork
19:09
paperwork and background checks um to go through with that. Um, and then also with hiring, we are back to now where
19:15
we'd be fully staffed in our custodial department. Um, we had one uh person leave, but we think we have that one
19:22
filled, too. Again, just waiting on paperwork. So, we'll be fully staffed again in our custodial crew, which is
19:27
very helpful. So, any questions on the new hires?
19:33
All right. And then our last item is the baseball. Baseball is in need of some more batting
19:41
cages. We have one currently out there right now. Um, and we're trying to run
19:46
95 kids through it for hitting practice. What's proposed out there is to do a
19:52
three bay hitting cage for them. Um, we're running into a time crunch that we
20:00
need to try to do as much as we can this fall with not knowing how our winter's
20:06
going to be or spring. to have that new hitting facility ready for them. So,
20:12
it'd be adding our existing cage is 15 by 72 foot. We'd be adding another one
20:17
to each side. So, just need some direction to go forth and get some of
20:22
that stuff ordered and done so it can be ready for next season.
20:29
Yeah, I know that's been a sore spot for a number of years. I think this that
20:34
came to the board in one shape or form. I think the
20:40
um 28e agreements were kind of standing in the way. We were needing to be able
20:45
to put that stuff through the Dallas Center city council process. And so some
20:52
of that 2080 uh work that we did, I don't know, a meeting or two ago, I
20:57
think helped kind of clear the way for for this. But I do know this is an
21:03
activity that um and an improvement that's been pretty sorely needed for a
21:08
number of years. Yeah. And I think with the the work that we've done with that land swap, I think
21:14
we're ready to kind of get that moving and then be able to um looking with it with our activities department, this
21:21
would kind of be the first phase there um and trying to maximize that space that we have to make it as efficient as
21:27
possible um and get the best price we can. And then there's some other things that we can do to get some storage and
21:32
things out there for baseball in the next, you know, the next year as well. So, is it kind of sight prep and
21:38
concrete yet this fall and then put the cages up in the spring? Yeah. If we could get our our goal would
21:43
be if we can get the concrete poured yet this fall, then we would we would then hopefully be able to get everything set
21:49
for spring ball. If we don't get that concrete poured, we're probably not going to be ready for spring ball, just
21:54
depending on how wet it is this winter and what's going on. So, that could really put us in a time. We have we have
22:01
lined up the um demolition of the fence around it and things that we need to do
22:06
and then we can get that concrete poured in and ready to go. Great. Thanks. Where's the funding coming from for this
22:14
couple dollars? That's I figured. Okay. Thank you.
22:21
Any other questions? Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
22:27
Thank you. Uh Tim Oswald with Piper Sandler.
22:36
Well, good evening. Thanks for your time. Um so this is a discussion about what happens should the
22:43
election pass um next week and um kind of steps to moving forward. And I I'm
22:51
going to apologize in advance for discussing IRS type rules for a little bit, but we kind of need to go over
22:57
them. So you can understand a little bit. Um Michelle and I and your your attorney
23:04
Beth have been talking some about uh the prospect of trying to sell some of of
23:09
the bonds here yet this calendar year. And that that causes me to want to pause
23:15
and and tell you one thing that's really important. In in the eyes of the IRS,
23:20
a year is January 1 to December 31st. We're all used to thinking about July 1
23:27
to June 30th, but the IRS because so many different governments that they
23:32
regulate all across the country, different fiscal years in different states, they have just simply said
23:38
calendar year is the is a year. IRS rules are calendar yeardriven rules and
23:44
whatever you did in one calendar year has no effect on what you do in the next
23:50
calendar year. What I mean by that is in some years you could issue bonds that meet certain exemptions from the IRS
23:57
rules and then and in the immediately following year you might issue bonds
24:02
that are subject to the IRS rules. Both are okay. And so um one of the things
24:09
that the IRS regulates is um interest earnings on bond proceeds. So, um, when
24:18
you sell bonds, the money comes to the district, all of it, and, um, you don't
24:26
spend it all the next day. It sits in the district's investment accounts and
24:31
it earns interest. And Michelle has the luxury of having to track all of that
24:36
and then uh, deal with IRS consultant who helps to make sure that the district
24:41
complied with the with the rules. doing okay so far. All right. So, let's talk
24:47
about what what are the rules because that's the key thing. Uh rule number one is you can ear you cannot earn
24:54
a rate of interest higher than the rate of interest on the bond unless you have
25:00
an exception. So, for example, very simple terms, let's say the bond has an interest rate
25:06
of 3%. If you earn 4% you're earning 1% more than the rate of
25:13
interest on the bonds and therefore you're earning 1% of arbitrage
25:19
and you would owe that 1% to the IRS at the end of the time doing okay still.
25:26
Okay. There are exceptions where you get to keep that 1%. Uh, and the first
25:33
exception for a school district is that you sell no more than 15 million of
25:39
bonds in that year. Well, you sold no bonds in calendar year 2025.
25:46
So, um, you would have the ability to sell 15 million of bonds yet this
25:51
calendar year if we scurry about and and and get all get all our work done ahead
25:57
of time. Uh if you do that, you have a three-year window to spend the money.
26:04
And after three years, any money that's sitting uh idle at that point, Michelle
26:10
has to restrict the interest rate that it's earning to not more than the interest rate on the bond.
26:16
You get to keep whatever interest you earned. So, we like that exception because it's kind of a there's no real
26:23
tracking mechanism. Um the IRS just simply g says if you're under 15 million. We're just not going to worry.
26:31
I'm imparting some little lingo there. But so what happens now? You're voting a
26:36
much larger number than that, right? And so eventually you're going to sell bonds that are more than 15 million and you're
26:45
going to become subject to the rule. And so the rule is that you have to have spent the money within two years of when
26:51
you sold the bond and you have to meet these sixmonth tests.
26:57
uh of spending. And so after six months, you have to spend 10% of the money, 45%
27:04
after one year, 75 after 18 months, and 100% after two
27:09
years. And if you meet those tests, you also get to keep the interest earnings, including the arbitrage. If you don't
27:16
meet those tests, you're going to write a check to the IRS for any amount of interest you earn in excess of the
27:23
interest on the interest rate on the bond. And it's a it's an accounting exercise
27:29
and and a bit of a pain for Michelle. So, um,
27:35
still doing okay. All right. So, the it seems to me that
27:41
you're going to sell some bonds that are subject to the two-year test. Question is when? And and while we've
27:50
had a couple well one discussion with your architects, in fairness, it's way
27:56
too early to know what the project construction cash flow might actually look like. Probably have a reasonable
28:02
idea as to how fast you'll spend money on design costs. But in terms of when
28:08
will we let a bid, when will they start, how long will they build, we're talking about real rough estimates for right now
28:16
of, you know, well, we think it'll be a two or a three-year construction cycle. We need to give your architects a little
28:22
more space to um to to do their preliminary leg work and then we can
28:28
revisit the how fast you can spend money.
28:33
The bond issue that in my mind, the bond issue that you would trigger the IRS
28:39
rules is one where you have a pretty good idea how fast the money's going out the door
28:45
so that you're reasonably certain that you've borrowed an amount that doesn't cause you to have to write the IRS a
28:52
check. Now, there can be unforeseen events, but that's the that's kind of my thought
28:58
process on how much you should borrow and when. I welcome your questions or
29:04
comments to the contrary if you'd like. Um the logic is for this discussion for
29:12
today is what if we sell 15 million of bonds and close before the end of
29:18
December lock in our ex uh that broader exception and then come back you'll
29:24
you'll use that money to pay your design costs during the next few months and
29:30
come back to you probably during budget season when the architects have done
29:36
more work with a plan on when to sell the rest of the bonds that's tied to how
29:41
fast they expect money to go out the door. So, what questions can I ask answer?
29:50
Can you just give us a little bit of your thinking just in terms of the bond market? So, it's good to know these tests and um I think it makes sense that
29:58
we'd want to understand project cash flow and this is a little different. I mean, there's a there's a big project
30:04
with the high school that obviously is going to be where a lot of the money will go, but there's really work being
30:10
done to every school in the district. Um, and and so there's going to be a lot of
30:17
money kind of going out maybe early to to do some of those things or simultaneous with the high school.
30:23
Correct. And so, um, fair point that we'd need to do that. But I guess my question is more just about the bond market and kind of
30:29
where that's at now and if we were to sell 15 million, you know, there's probably a window of time in 26 just
30:36
maybe just a little bit from you. Do we just need not to worry about that and sell it when we need to sell it or is
30:42
there some thinking about where the bond market is and is there logical points
30:47
across call it the next year that we should be targeting to sell bonds?
30:52
Well, um I think you're going to choose need to
30:59
choose to sell bonds around two times two two timing elements. One is when do
31:05
you think you're going to need money which is when you've let uh the ancillary or even the high school
31:13
projects and the second one is budget season. Um neither of which are the bond
31:19
market driven stuff. It's just those factors that affect when you need money
31:24
for your project. Um the bond markets are largely functioning correctly and
31:30
with reasonable access for for folks like yourself. Um I'm not here today to
31:36
say I think there's a area of concern with access to the markets on reasonable
31:42
terms. I think you're gonna as we sit today have access um things can change
31:49
but as we sit today so I think you're going to want to think about accessing
31:55
the markets around kind of when do you need money and how does this play into our budget adoption process. One last
32:02
comment before I we go on. In Iowa you can sell bonds for 20 years but not 20
32:08
years in one month. So, we often do a lot of this kind of bond sale action
32:13
work in April, May, um, with a with a goal of closing the
32:20
bond in June, having a 20 budget cycle, 20-year budget cycle. Remember, you and I pay property
32:27
taxes September and March. These bonds are paid from taxes. So
32:36
county collects the taxes following month, October and May, April, sorry,
32:43
turns the money over to Michelle. So we don't want to set a bond payment for February 1st. Michelle would not have
32:49
the cash necessary. So we'll be we'll be setting payments around the end of the
32:55
fiscal year, usually June one, sometimes May one. 20 years from June one becomes the
33:02
exercise that we end up doing. Um, so we would probably not push to
33:07
sell a bond in March and have because it would be a 19-year
33:13
bond and that we would lose that 20th year that has cash flow implications for the rest of the bond sales.
33:20
Sorry, I interrupt you. No, perfect. One other question is the 15 million and 25 is that subject to the
33:26
two-year test as well? It's a it's a uh it is not. It's a three-year test. And if three years of
33:34
money still there. You just have to restrict the earnings at that point to no greater than the interest rate on the
33:40
bond. Okay. Yeah. That's why we like it. It's got kind of a get out of jail free pass to
33:46
it. So So then that may then there may be a small bond sale then in 27 or there
33:54
could be I think there will be. Yeah. Yeah. Four sales.
33:59
Four. Yeah. across four different years. Correct.
34:04
Got it. Okay. But again, this is all very theoretical
34:11
until your design team has had more opportunity to do their work and to come
34:17
back to you and say, "Here's when we want to let construction and occupy the space." And that's when Michelle and I
34:24
will get back to working on cash flows and come back to you with better ideas
34:30
for when to sell the remainder of the bonds.
34:43
What other questions do we have for Tim?
34:53
Great. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks, Jim. Good to see you.
35:01
All right, Miss Morris, Miss Highland.
35:09
Now that you've heard all that, we're going to kick it down to kindergarten level.
35:15
So,
35:22
There you go. So, first of all, amazing work. I want to brag on these
35:28
guys back here. They didn't know I was going to do this, but these are the kindergarten superheroes right here. An
35:33
amazing work day today throughout um the whole building with the whole staff. It's such a great opportunity. As I went
35:40
around the building and teachers had these long lists of things, I got everything checked off my list. They
35:46
were so excited. They're I mean it's all and they're crossed off all these things on their lists and getting ready for
35:51
conferences um doing their grades just all the things that they just that just build up and build up. So it was amazing
35:59
day to do that. I saw like special ed teachers meeting with the classroom teachers too and just having some of
36:05
those meetings. But these guys right here, they're taking on a new challenge.
36:10
Um they're willing to do they're like sure we'll do it. And um that's what makes
36:15
them uh some superheroes. Uh clever touches. We have had none in our building. We have had uh projectors,
36:22
interactive projectors, and they're kind of starting to um not work so well. And
36:27
I think they got to the point they were kind of tired of them not working so well. So they volunteered to kind of be
36:33
um the first group of people to have those. So we've had them purchased and just look waiting for when could we get
36:39
those installed. So, um, Travis and Sean and Hopper's team, they all came in this morning and they installed them. And
36:45
that's a new piece of technology that they worked all morning to install them.
36:50
When did they get them done? When did you guys Yeah. So, after lunch, they got a
36:56
tutorial from um our tech department and they're ready to go tomorrow and use
37:01
this new technology with their students and I they're excited. We'll see how they look tomorrow. more nervous,
37:07
but um but super I'm I'm just super proud of them to take on that challenge and be like, "Sure, we'll do it." You
37:13
know, whatever is best. Um we know we need this and so uh they're willing to jump in and do anything as with the
37:19
kindergarten kickstart. So, piloted this program and we told you we would come back and share the results. So, I'm
37:25
gonna let them take over.
37:31
Hello. Good evening. I'm Stephanie Schultz. Um first of all, we Just wanted to thank all of you for um just
37:38
supporting us as we piloted our kindergarten kickstart initiative. Um we
37:43
do feel like it was a very positive experience for our students and for our staff. And tonight we would just like to
37:50
share our feedback and also the parents feedback. We did send a survey out after everything was over and just share with
37:57
you how everything went. So first um we'll do some things that
38:04
went well from the teachers perspective. So some teacher feedback um we felt like
38:09
kids form relation relationships with the entire team. Um this has been
38:15
helpful during our PLC conversations um lunch duty recess etc. Open house night
38:22
we got to meet all the kids and families that came. Um transportation forms were filled out which was huge. That's a big
38:29
stress for us at the beginning of the year. So, it was nice to have a majority done. Um, we also had um a lot of
38:36
various staff members help with that check-in. Um, we've been able to have powerful conversations about balancing
38:42
classrooms um at the beginning of that time together, but also um since then
38:48
we've had great conversations because we know the kids pretty well um through our PLC time. Also, switching kids went very
38:54
well. students seem to enjoy visiting four different classrooms each day for different activities. They usually came
38:59
in, smiled, excited um to be in the different rooms. So, it was neat.
39:05
And then I'm going to share the parent feedback of things that went well. Um most of the families understood the
39:11
importance of balancing the classrooms to meet all of our students needs. They appreciated all the communication prior
39:17
to school starting and during that first week, we really tried to overcommunicate. Um so, we had our
39:22
spring parent meeting. AJ, thank you so much for all of your help in your posts. Um, we had parent square posts as
39:28
teachers. We had our open house night where we were all there to answer questions. Um, we also sent reminders
39:34
and information during that first week of school. And then on that Wednesday when we had um our placement messages go
39:41
out and parents also felt like the transition to the permanent classrooms was a positive experience for their
39:48
child. Some things we want to improve on for
39:53
next year. Um, have more volunteers at the door for check-in to speed up the
39:58
process a little bit quicker. Um, we want to put names on their wristbands instead of their name tags. Those seem
40:04
to fall off really easily or they just pulled off. Um, uh, we want to allow
40:10
parents to come in, um, only on the first day of school instead of the first official day of their new classroom. and
40:17
then continue open house in the library to check in, meet all the teachers, and drop off supplies, but allow families to
40:23
peek into the classrooms if they would like. We could have a couple helper helpers monitoring the classroom in that
40:29
area just so then it was monitored and people weren't going in. So, we thought
40:34
that'd be a good idea so people could see it. Oh.
40:40
Um, we also had 11 families who brought their students on Wednesday, even though communication was sent through parent
40:46
square and on open house night that we wouldn't have school that Wednesday. Um, we're going to put a bracelet on kids
40:52
Tuesday afternoon that says no school on Wednesday as a reminder. So hopefully that will be helpful.
41:00
We were able to catch and that was the great thing is we we knew who they were and I was up at drop
41:06
off and like nope get back in your car. So, we were able to catch
41:12
um and then I'm going to share the parent feedback piece of things that they would like to see improved for next
41:17
year. Um the big thing was parents want to be able to walk in their child on the first day of school instead of like
41:24
their first official day with their permanent teacher. Um they wanted to be able to see our kindergarten classrooms
41:30
um either open house night or before their child started. That was important to them. Um and then just comm we
41:36
although we communicated it maybe having some more communication about like why we're doing Kickstart um
41:44
balancing behaviors um also having those interactions between students and adults
41:49
and then even the little things like telling parents about like their the student connections about we we may not
41:55
want you to be in the same classroom as your cousin or your neighbor or your daycare friends. just trying to balance
42:01
all those little things that go into creating those good classrooms.
42:08
Um here were a few specific comments from parents on our survey that we got
42:14
back. Um one parent shared that I love the new and exciting way to get to know our students and place them with care
42:20
and connection. Uh kickstart meeting was very helpful and great had great communication.
42:26
Um, one parent said she totally gets it. The need for something like this. I've seen what happens when classes get
42:32
stacked with needs. It's very disruptive and harder to move or transition kids after year after year has started. And I
42:39
don't know all the logistics or restrictions, but I do believe there might be other ways to meet the need without disrupting the first day of
42:45
school. She thought it was really organized though.
42:51
And then just overall, we had 25 um parents respond out of around 73 um
42:59
families. Um 23 of those 25 had positive experiences. Two did share negative
43:05
experiences. Um, and those that shared the positive experiences gave us good feedback on how we can improve or what
43:12
they would like to have or um to know or to do differently for next year, which we kind of shared earlier some changes
43:18
that we would be willing to make and make it a little better for families. Principal.
43:24
So, I'm going to repeat some of the things they said, too. Um, because the things that they said as as they they
43:30
just mentioned, but um they're already thinking about the feedback that they got from parents. They're like, "Oh,
43:36
well, we could do that different." But these were coming from the parents who who said it was a good idea, but did you think about this or did you think about
43:42
this? It's just like the open house night. We really would like to see the classrooms the first day of school. We
43:47
didn't let the parents walk in. We we thought, "Oh, well, they'll want to come in when it's their classroom on the and
43:53
their first day would be with their well, that's not that's not what they they wanted to come in with their
43:59
student on the first day. So, these are things that we're going to consider and we're going to look at for next year.
44:05
But these are some things that I noted um some misconceptions. Um we heard that it gave the opportunity
44:12
to cherrypick their students. It wasn't a draft and it wasn't cherrypicking, but it still seemed, you know, sometimes
44:17
there was that misconception that there's just this drawing of I want that student because they're the best. I want
44:22
they I will tell you these guys spent a lot of time even before that day. um the data that we had from preschool uh
44:29
preschool actually and Gina um from the students that they had data on made
44:35
class list for us and we started with that and they looked at the data they had but then all the other students
44:42
coming in that we don't have data on trying to place them the best we could but starting with something and then um
44:51
then really taking that uh from that first day and then seeing I mean, where
44:56
what changes do we need to make? Because even when uh when we do a class from first to second grade, sometimes we get
45:03
it wrong because sometimes those kids weren't together before and then we put them together in the next grade and it's
45:09
like, whoa, that wasn't a good choice. So, um it it's not cherrypicking or
45:16
because I like that student. It's it's really what is the mix. It's not about the teachers. It's about the mix of
45:22
students. Um, and it was interesting because um, and and the parents said,
45:28
"This this came from my five-year-old, but the 5-year-old gave the impression that they were with that same teacher
45:34
the whole day." They weren't. They went to all classes both days, but yet when the student would come home and report,
45:40
they were like, "Well, I was I was in the the classroom with my teacher the whole day." Well, you know, there
45:46
five-year-olds can't give the the accurate what happened. And once again, many of the students um probably were
45:54
traveling with the same group of students that they started with because we're not doing fruit basket upset. That
46:01
kind of defeats the purpose. It's a lot of thoughtful preparation goes into making those lists to begin with. But
46:08
before the end of the first day, I said I was involved in some convers. I went down, you know, midday lunch. Okay, talk
46:14
to me. Let's let's talk about it. What do you see already? Where do you see maybe we might need to mix up some
46:20
students? Maybe mix We were making some changes day one before the first day was
46:25
over where we had moved we and it wasn't like a lot, but you move a couple of students, it changes the dynamics of a
46:32
classroom a great deal. And so you're not going to see that and you won't know
46:38
that. And the the students don't know that either. And they don't see that. They're five. Um these guys just
46:45
definitely my perception what I said is they they are so they collaborated so
46:50
well together. Um really really being very thoughtful in that and I think that
46:55
goes into some of my more of my notes
47:01
because um they know these students at a different level. Um
47:09
they know I don't think that's what I meant to say. They know them differently than they knew students previously.
47:17
They know the students coming in now. You're you're like Patty, they just saw them for two days, but before it took
47:24
them a long time to get to know um I think Katherine and you guys were talking about when they're in PLC's and
47:30
they're talking about the students and their data, they know the students. They know them by name. They they can recognize them because they did spend
47:37
time with them when they're out on the playground, out at recess, in the hallway. they know those students names
47:42
whereas before it's like well they never saw them they weren't in their classroom. The other interesting thing is those students have been with those
47:49
teachers and see them as their as other teachers too. So that's been good too. So they're aware of who they are. They
47:55
know these students and this has started a new practice that we started doing because I know how collaborative they
48:02
are and because they know because they've put these classes together and they know the makeup of each one of the
48:08
classes. When we have new kindergarten students move in, it used to be, okay, they have the fewest number of students
48:14
or they're the next person to get a new student. That's where that student goes. I don't do that anymore in kindergarten
48:20
because they know the students in all of their classes. A new student comes in, I
48:26
come down and talk to them like, "Where do you think we should put this student?" We put them somewhere, but
48:31
that may not be where that student ends up. we see how that student does and it's like I think this would be a
48:37
student that would be better in another classroom. So all year it's that level
48:43
of trust that they have with each other that it's like I think that this might be a better mix with your classroom and
48:51
we're able to do that throughout the year so that we can keep that good balance
48:56
and I think that's it. So what thoughts questions do you have for me for these guys? they have put a lot of work into
49:02
this and we were thrilled. Um, like I said, we had we didn't get a lot of
49:08
response back, but about a third of them.
49:14
Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for being willing to do this like crazy, exciting, amazing new thing. like
49:20
it's bananas, but also like really cool and hopefully something that um sets a
49:26
precedent for more collaboration and more creative ways to do the best for
49:32
all of our students. Um the only real question I have is if you have an idea
49:38
of what percentage of kindergarters or students coming in you had data on
49:43
beforehand, like how about how many you had preschool data on. You know what? I didn't count that up this time. We did. We had that before.
49:52
30 or 40 kids out of the se. Yeah. Okay. So halfish.
49:59
Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I can get that exactly too. I do that every year. I just I didn't figure that
50:04
up. It's not in my head. But you had other things going on, Patty. I don't I don't know. I did. So yeah.
50:10
No. I mean, and and to work on on that amount of data, I mean, honestly, is
50:15
kind of good, I guess. you know, like obviously 100% would be fantastic, but it would be great. Um,
50:20
and it's not to say that um I mean some of the students that um come in maybe
50:26
have had preschool from other preschools, but we don't have any of that data, right? Um they might have been at other daycare
50:32
preschools, but they run and operate differently than the DCG preschools do, too. So, um the data that we have all
50:39
comes from our DCG preschools and transitional programming. And so,
50:45
um, like I said, we appreciate their ability to help us, you know, with what they have to give us
50:51
a starting point because without that, we're just Oh, absolutely. And so, we appreciate working with them,
50:56
too, because that's always very helpful. And, you know, we've talked about like um, April and I have conversations all
51:02
the time and and we look at that also. And um I don't know what what your percentage of students, April, that come
51:09
into to Northridge that have went to preschool, but it's higher than mine.
51:15
Yeah, probably a little bit higher. Um been less the last couple of years. I
51:20
also think our preschool numbers have been down the last couple of years. Yeah, I know. It's it's changed, hasn't
51:25
it? It has changed quite quite significantly, I would say, since we
51:31
went to neighborhood schools. It's not because we need to neighbor schools. It's just
51:36
it is what it is. That's where it fell in the timeline. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.
51:41
Any other thoughts? Well, I want to thank you also for everything. This is really exciting. Do we see this expanding out to the
51:47
other elementary schools? Is that something we're looking at? Is it kind of up to each each building and and what
51:55
they see as best for them? Because like every building has a different mix, a different clientele.
52:00
um you know, we saw a need in our building and they may not have the same
52:07
um concerns or the same need that we saw amongst our students. And when we were seeing the that that buildup from every
52:14
year of just the big emotions in a classroom and I can tell you this year
52:20
what was set up, it would have been your classroom had a lot of big emotions. So Stephanie is here tonight saying thank
52:28
goodness We did some switching and moving around because, you know, it's like it's just
52:34
where they end up and just it's just that some kids just haven't had the background of experiences and they they
52:41
just end up in the same place and and it's not by it's just because we don't know them. And how do you get to know
52:48
them or how do you try to mix them up? And and in two days, can you tell? We can tell a lot in two days. we could
52:54
tell the big emotions to get those students um mixed up into different
53:00
classes. Thank you for trying this and thank you
53:06
for coming back to tell us about it because I've been looking forward to this ever since I knew we were doing this. So, I've been very excited to hear
53:12
your report back to us. So, thank you. Awesome. They put a lot of extra work and um I appreciate all that they've
53:18
done. Great team. Great job. Thank you. Thank you very much.
53:26
And as April and Gina come up, Shaylee, to your question, we brought back last
53:32
spring the kindergarten roundup at all buildings. So our families could get in check at everything. So that'll be back
53:38
and then Yeah. schools will have the option, do they want to do the kickstart thing again or or not? Yeah.
53:44
Yep. Exactly. Good evening everyone. Um, thank you for
53:49
the opportunity for us to come and talk a little bit, and I say us, it's Gina. Gina is going to talk with you about um,
53:56
transitional kindergarten. Um, we're she's just got a lot of great things to share about this opportunity that we
54:03
have for um, students in our district that um, we felt that it was important that maybe we got out in front of
54:10
everyone. So, after. All right, here we go. All right, so
54:15
we've got a lot of little pictures on here, too. You can see some my little cuties this year. Uh but just starting out, this is kind of what it looks like
54:21
on the um school website if you look. Thank you AJ by the way. The who, what, when, where, why kind of thing out
54:27
there. So you want to find out about transitional, that's where you go. That is a typical schedule right there on
54:33
what we fit in. And today we were doing a little extra work and at one point April stopped and said, "You do all of
54:38
that in a half a day?" And I said, "Yes, that's why I'm so tired in the evening." So three hours.
54:44
In three hours. So, there is a lot going on. Um, but that's just kind of an overview of what the schedule would look
54:49
like. And then on here, I kind of broke it down and told you what we do and just kind of what is happening in those areas
54:55
when they come in right away. They have an activity they need to do. Could be writing their name, practicing letters,
55:00
numbers, any fine motor skills they might have to work on. If they've missed something the day before, this is a good
55:05
catchup time. Then our social or morning meeting, we use second steps which I started when I was at South Prairie and
55:11
has just carried over to helping those kids like what to do when you're frustrated. Different ways to ask for
55:16
help. How do you ask a friend to play? Those kind of things. Also, the greeting. We're really working on
55:22
getting to know everyone's name and knowing who's in your class. And instead of, hey, him did this or he did that,
55:28
you'll actually know what their names are. Then we move right into number corner. I do a a bridged or modified um
55:34
bridges, but we do a lot with like the tally marks, the 10 frames, um knowing what comes before and after a number,
55:40
rolling dice, counting right away, subetizing, um all of those things. And then it leads into snack, which we do
55:46
watch a little book of the day, and then while they don't have to watch that, they can whisper with their friends if
55:51
they want to. Then we get the wiggles out at recess and build those friendships. We're out with the kindergarten teams as well. Um, and then
55:59
working on those low our large motor skills. Then when they come in, they know we all start singing the song for
56:05
you, fly. Yes, I've made that up. And we do some letter names and letter sounds, heart words. Um, that's all of our
56:11
phonics, all of our learning that goes with that. And then move into our centers. Our center time is where they
56:16
get to play independently in groups. They pick their spots. At the same time, we are either I'm working with them in a
56:23
small group. either one-on-one or one on four is my max. Um it's also the same
56:28
time that they have specials. So if we have specials, we kind of rotate our day as we go. And then um at the very end of
56:35
that, we take the last 10 minutes and do our heardy, which is our phmic awareness. And right now it's a whole group thing. We'd like to move it to a
56:42
small group so we can actually zone right in on what those kids need. Um and then we move into the whole group
56:48
instruction. So that's the fine motor and theme building. And then we pack up. It's time to go home. and I have lunch
56:54
and it's ready to happen again. So, that's that's my day. And then we do have specials. We meet
57:00
once in a six day cycle. It's 20-minute class. We have PE and library. And then u Miss and I are going to meet for art.
57:06
We meet like two times a year to do a project with the kids.
57:12
So, my dippy this year or first year was to find data that answered the following question. How can I help them be more
57:19
successful and ready for kindergarten? I'm really diving deep into what I am doing for a curriculum and what needs to
57:24
be there and the stuff that they already know and kind of taking that out and removing to what's more up to date. So
57:31
that just that general feedback for the program and what other districts are doing around and I've contacted a lot of
57:36
other districts either looking online or emailing um other teachers or principles and finding some information. So last
57:42
year I collected the data for other districts and there's some surveys that you're going to see um and I believe
57:49
that's the next one. Yep. So there are surveys. We sent one out for the past DCG transitional kindergarten parents.
57:55
It was formerly known as optional kindergarten. I also had the kindergarten parents from the 2425 year.
58:02
And then I also questioned all the kindergarten teachers.
58:08
This year I'm working with April and Shana on the following curriculum resources standards and then report card statements. So we're going to update a
58:14
bunch of that this year. And then this program's really evolved over the years to meet the needs of the everchanging
58:19
students and their parents. Things are way different than they were when I started. Um we've not had as many open
58:24
enrolled students because a lot of districts are now offering those programs. I think this year um I've
58:30
already had two people contact to ask about what the program is about and what they should do to start the program. So
58:36
it's becoming pretty prevalent around us. So thank you for your time. If you have any other questions about anything,
58:42
um let me know. Any
58:49
questions? Any questions from the board? I do have one question for you. So, I am a huge fan of this. Obviously, a son
58:55
that's a seventh grader who was in your class a few years back, but um we've had
59:01
a lot of questions and feedback from uh and we've talked a lot about do we make this full day? Do we keep it half day?
59:08
What are your thoughts on that? Can I aside from like
59:15
aside from staffing, I would love to know. Well, yeah, there are there are differing opinions out there. Um, I do
59:21
feel like there are so many full-time positions out there that are just getting more time with those
59:27
students and are able to dive a little deeper into those skills that they're not being prepared for at home. We've
59:32
talked about how we are doing a lot more teaching basic skills that they would normally have had in years past with
59:39
their family and that's just being overlooked. I would be able to work on those skills more. Um I feel like I'm
59:44
just sticking my toe in the water when I could actually help teach them to swim basically. So I do feel the full day
59:52
would really benefit the kids. Thank you.
59:57
And I and as you know, I mean, my job is to do the best with taxpayers dollars.
1:00:05
And I know that we've got to decide. We can't everybody can't get what they want. Um, in a perfect world, what I
1:00:13
would like to do is offer both. Um, offer a full day program and a half-day
1:00:19
program. We got feedback from people both, but I know that's not the reality
1:00:26
of, you know, our current state. I think there's benefits
1:00:31
for both. Um, I do think Gina would have
1:00:37
more time. Of course, time is, you know, um the one thing that I would like to
1:00:43
look at and explore is if we continue with a half-day program, how can we is
1:00:49
there something we can do on Wednesdays? Um can parents sign up to bring their kids in for an additional time? Um that
1:00:57
would give a little more time. Um but I think there's benefits to both. Um, and
1:01:04
knowing that having to balance the budget is something that we have to consider also.
1:01:10
I don't know all the ins and outs. You just know you. I just I just
1:01:16
You do a fantastic job. So, thank you. She does do a phenomenal job. Any other questions?
1:01:24
Thank you very much. Yeah, I just want to say it's been I mean I've had the
1:01:29
opportunity years ago to be a preschool director in the district and that was a phenomenal opportunity. I learned a lot
1:01:35
about um preschool. This has also been an opportunity that um I have learned so
1:01:43
much from Gina and um I have started to say you're not always going to do this
1:01:48
but we have to know the things that you do. Um and so the work that her and um
1:01:54
Shana have and I'm just sitting there listening. It's going to be really great the work that they're doing too. But um
1:02:00
we are extremely blessed to have Gina as our transitional kindergarten teacher in
1:02:07
the district. Thank you. Thanks Gina. Thanks
1:02:13
kindergarten team. Right. Dr. Krenza. Okay. Just have a quick few updates for
1:02:19
you. The first is in regards to state reporting. So you can see I told you it got quiet and then it got busy again. So
1:02:25
uh we had certified enrollment uh count day October 1st with that same time we
1:02:31
start working on fall student reporting in Iowa which is looks at all of our program data and our uh fall uh
1:02:38
waitings. And so uh that kind of goes through a couple like uh correct or submit then you correct and then you
1:02:44
resubmit. That is also tied with certified enrollment. So those are those first three together. We did update our
1:02:49
tag plan and cover sheet to the state. Um, our universal desk audits for both K12 and preschool are both in progress.
1:02:57
We submitted fall beds on the 21st of October. And uh, I apologize Carrie, I
1:03:02
wasn't sure what date you finished. I think I did this before you hit submit. So, um, but our fall bed staff, which
1:03:08
accounts for who's in our district, lure and salary and all the benefits, uh, that has also been completed by Jamie
1:03:14
and Carrie and his team. So, uh, we're in pretty good shape. Uh, the bottom just provides you just an overview of
1:03:20
SRRI. So, questions about state reporting. All right. Um, professional development
1:03:27
wise, you can see over the course of October, um, things are going very smoothly. I really am enjoying. I know
1:03:33
with the amount of content that we cover, it's always just a good reminder those every Wednesdays are busy. uh on
1:03:40
any given day whe if it's at a building of course or at the district um they're getting good content there but when we
1:03:47
have our flex days and our PLC days we have curriculum reviews being done as
1:03:52
well as PLC's and our flex days um you'll see all the teams that we meet with which ranges from some curriculum
1:03:59
teams to special ed EL tag nurses it's incredible uh the work that happens and
1:04:05
that that takes almost a small army to coordinate all of that and individual planning. So, uh, we continue with great
1:04:11
work there. Been really pleased. We had some additional October is a busy busy
1:04:17
month. I think every conference that could ever be held in the state of Iowa is held in October. I understand why
1:04:22
with weather and those kinds of things, but the two big ones I would say is we had a chance to send teams from every
1:04:27
building to the ITC conference. So, along with Stephen Hopper and getting great information about instructional
1:04:33
technology and how that we can enhance learning in our classrooms. just had an email from a teacher in our district
1:04:40
just um sharing how excited she was to be able to come back and implement some of the creative things that she's used
1:04:46
there. So those outside PD sessions are super valuable and they bring back things to our district. And then we also
1:04:52
um proud to share that our uh talented we call our gifted and talented services
1:04:57
team all of the teachers GT teachers were able to present along with Kate Bonstro from H Heartland Aea uh
1:05:03
presented at the ITG conference. So we had two two great days of learning there. Um questions about professional
1:05:10
development. Do we see at some point um I know we
1:05:16
have instructional coaches that help with the curriculum planning and stuff at some point given that we are moving
1:05:23
toward implementing two new technology and like these lower level classrooms like the the clever touch and stuff. Do
1:05:30
you see us bringing on a role of like uh a tech coach?
1:05:35
We just talked about that the other day. Funny that you should mention that as we're starting to think about next year.
1:05:41
Um you know, we need to look at our our TLC budget and see what positions might
1:05:46
be are needed. Um and what any changes that we would propose to make to the TLC
1:05:51
grant. U Mrs. Olsen oversees that work, but but definitely would be hard. Uh what we see right now is definitely have
1:05:57
a focus on the hardware side with Stephen and that's an incredible team that he has. They're fixing the
1:06:03
computers. They're working on connectivity. They're doing all the behind the scenes hardware work. The
1:06:08
software side, how do we begin to, you know, incorporate technology into our lessons? It's definitely a need area for
1:06:14
us. So we don't have exact exact answers now, but the need has been expressed. Yeah, thanks Nancy. That's when when
1:06:21
Shana, Greg, Steve and I met to kind of talk about how we can continue to help those. We're so blessed that our tech
1:06:29
team and teaching and learning work together. They're not too but they both
1:06:34
kind of share with me like the gap is probably in that here's a new piece of technology or new software.
1:06:41
it. We probably don't have the manpower or expertise in a tech world to go teach that part, but then we don't have Craig
1:06:50
and Shana can't they maybe don't have the tech knowledge or whatever. So, is there this missing
1:06:55
position that is maybe a was a teacher, enjoys teaching but has this tech skill
1:07:02
desire that they're actually the ones training on clever touches, meet going into classrooms and here's how you can
1:07:07
use this software. So, it's perfect timing for this. Yeah, we don't want the technology to be a substitution for the
1:07:15
high quality teaching. We want it to be an additive. Bingo. Stephen did a really great job and I
1:07:21
think it's because of he's had experiences in other districts to talk about different models that could be used. So, is it one person for the
1:07:29
entire district who's spread pretty thin trying to go and cover K12? Is it a
1:07:35
stipen position in which we give teachers some money to then be the tech person on site and then we get creative
1:07:42
around that? I think we still have a lot of details to meet out there as well as some other TLC requests which we could
1:07:48
speak about later. Um but definitely it's something I think as the district you know um continues to shift
1:07:54
technology is getting is changing so rapidly um we need to be prepared for that. So thank you. Yeah. Other
1:08:02
questions about PD? Uh I wanted to take a minute and recognize uh we had our first SCAK
1:08:09
meeting of the year. Uh personally, it's just a favorite of mine and I'll say why is uh getting people together to talk
1:08:16
about the state of our district. You can see the agenda there. Talk about and be able to brag about our um student
1:08:22
achievement data, but also to identify some areas for growth and improvement. Uh I didn't count the number there that
1:08:28
night, but I it was a lot. like I think there was 50 at least 50 if I was counting. Uh what's nice is that we get
1:08:34
some voices heard from different levels. We had student present. Students continue they are so great. We have
1:08:40
several on the list but also they get so busy with their schedules um that we'll continue to think of other ways for
1:08:45
students. But I'm grateful that it was a beautiful night that night. So to have 50 people stay for an hour and also
1:08:51
heard from Dr. Bloom about facilities. Um our next one is February 3rd. So um Dr. Bloom and I have that on our list to
1:08:58
kind of plan that next content which will look to be things like bullying and harassment which is required as part of
1:09:03
our updates, a midyear data update and then just more district progress. So I'm
1:09:08
thankful for that team. We did have also uh kudos to Austin Roy, our high school
1:09:13
assistant principal and Mrs. Kunda from Oakview who presented on the district career and academic plan. And just a
1:09:20
shout out to both them. You will be hearing next month from Colin Lane who is our new career and technical
1:09:27
education teacher leader program teacher leader and he is going to come and talk a little bit about just updates to CTE
1:09:34
his position which is undoubtedly tied to uh career and academic planning. You
1:09:39
will we are last year was really a planning year and kind of a come together and really restart the work.
1:09:46
This year is getting publicity out. We need to start talking more and more about careers and where what instruction
1:09:52
looks like. The state also added requirements at the middle school. So, fifth and sixth grade. So, um this is
1:09:58
getting exciting because it is so tied to outcomes for postsecary education too. So, more to come with DECAP
1:10:06
and that's it. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Bloom.
1:10:12
All right. Thank you, team. We start off with um we had one single family
1:10:18
building permit in Grimes last month. So just the one we had five in that Willow
1:10:24
Hills plat. I did reach out last month to Nikki Roa, the superintendent at Johnston, and she respectfully declined
1:10:32
my offer to just have her give us the land. Uh Nikki, it's it's tough for you
1:10:38
guys to get a bus out here. They go from Grimes to Johnson to Grimes. Let me She's very kind but said maybe another
1:10:45
day. So I tried um certified enrollment. I'm going to spend a little bit of time on this. If
1:10:53
you're looking in the packet, I'm really going to spend um just on the on the very first page
1:10:58
because the rest of them kind of get a little bit more granular. But the main three numbers I want to share with you.
1:11:04
So we have our official certified number of being down 41.6
1:11:11
six students. Remember the decimals get a little funky because ELLL IEPs, they all kind of have some different numbers,
1:11:18
but um when it comes to kind of state driven dollars, we're down 41. Those are
1:11:24
resident students. So they, you know, compared to last year, we had 41 less students that live in Dallas Center and
1:11:31
Grimes that go to DCG. So that of course is not not good news. Um, if you
1:11:37
remember last year, I think our number was about 55ish. So, it's it's less, which is good, but
1:11:43
it's still down. Now, we were up 16.6 in that open enrolled number. So, we do say
1:11:51
minus 41 from a resident count, but that served. How many kids are actually in
1:11:56
your building in front of a teacher? That number is is closer to a minus 25.
1:12:03
So that's kind of the difference between those two numbers. Um, so again, it's
1:12:09
better that it's not as much still a bummer that we're now uh three years in a row, but I'm going to talk about
1:12:15
something when I pull it up here in a second. The other number I want to bring to your attention at the bottom of the first page is the ESA funded students.
1:12:22
Last year we had 76. This year we have 118. So that's a that's a pretty big jump. What I do not
1:12:30
yet have for you are the number of kids that sat in this district physically
1:12:36
last year that now go to a private school. My belief is that still the
1:12:44
majority of those 118 went to a private school last year, but this is the first
1:12:50
year that the income caps are gone. So I think most likely and and when we get
1:12:57
the actual numbers and people will share that most of those probably went to those
1:13:03
private schools. They now just get the funding from the state because they didn't meet the guidelines the last
1:13:08
couple years. So again, it's somewhat of a educated guess, but I do not think we actually
1:13:14
have 40 or so kids that we taught last year that are not here. I think that
1:13:20
number's a lot smaller. But again, those ESA numbers did go up. There are more
1:13:26
students and families receiving state aid for those numbers um for those kids.
1:13:32
So, what I am going to try on the fly
1:13:38
to to share with you, I should have had it ready is
1:13:44
I I got an opportunity to meet with um the ad hoc committee on
1:13:50
Carrie last Tuesday. Tuesday, Thursday. Thanks. And shared some what I thought
1:13:56
to that team was some very interesting in enrollment data. So, if you will give me
1:14:03
a second. Sorry, gang. Come. Okay. I won't project it for you,
1:14:11
but I'm just going to kind of share. There were I looked at uh Michelle and I
1:14:18
looked at schools that are similar in size or in our little Hawkeye conference or
1:14:25
ones that are around us that get we get compared to a lot and found this to be pretty darn fascinating. DCG was down
1:14:33
about 41 students or 25 served. Ames down 61 and down 115 students served.
1:14:42
Ankeny is down 73 students minus 40
1:14:47
serve. So they have a little higher open enrollment. Indianola down 91. Johnston,
1:14:54
this is this was a a big one to me that I just didn't see coming. Johnston is down 66 certified students, 106 served
1:15:01
students. I I don't know this Nancy May. I'm not sure the last time Johnston was
1:15:06
down students. I don't know if this was Yeah, it's probably been a little bit for them. Norwok is up 40. They were one
1:15:13
of the few that are up, but their open enrollment out was 35, so they're up five. Pella is down almost 50.
1:15:20
Urbandale's down 62. West De Moine was down almost 300 students. Walke is up
1:15:29
395 certified, 344 served. Those of us that know this area, know
1:15:36
Walke well, I'm not sure that's half of what they thought was coming. like they're in the six, seven, 800 plus
1:15:44
students every year. That is a significant dip even though it's still up which is
1:15:49
which is good for them. This led to a great conversation with our team internally ad hoc
1:15:57
just about how much of this is a programming
1:16:03
question versus kind of a life cycle question. meaning we don't have a lot of homes
1:16:10
that are being built. They're coming, but we don't have a lot of access to where like Norwok, for example, just
1:16:17
opened a nice chunk of neighborhoods. So, I think when they were built, people moved in. I'm optimistic we're going to
1:16:23
be in the same boat. You know, when when the houses are there. I'm also excited
1:16:28
that we're going to diversify. I hope some of our housing complexes. We can't just have $750,000 homes for people to
1:16:36
buy. So, we're going to get some more town homes, condos, apartments, houses, but we are we know we're having less
1:16:43
kids. P County and Dallas County share that with us. I know Grimes is
1:16:48
optimistic about growth. Dallas Center, I met with their city manager two weeks ago, optimistic about where they're going. So, ad hoc's got an important
1:16:56
role at still looking at programming. We kind of shifted a little bit and I want to steal the spotlight from K. think
1:17:02
they're going to present maybe next month or in December like it's somewhat shifted to like okay let's look at what
1:17:09
DCG is best for kids staff families get creative not maybe the how do we get
1:17:16
more kids here because this data tells us a superintendent I thought put it pretty well in a meeting last week we
1:17:22
probably need to stop asking where are the kids going and more of a where are the kids this data tells us they're not
1:17:30
leaving DCG and going to Johnston. Johnson's down more than us. They're not going to Walke. Walk's down half. Like
1:17:39
it's it's probably a bigger I guess society issue than my gosh, they're
1:17:44
leaving DCG because of X. So interesting figures for all of us in the metro area.
1:17:51
I'm still very optimistic that that minus 41 is going to dip even lower next
1:17:56
year. Hopefully the following year after that maybe is there's some growth because we've got three neighborhoods around us that are starting to build
1:18:04
some basements, put in some roads and then optimistic in Dallas Center. I know they've got land ready to go. They're
1:18:10
talking with that contractor about what are the steps to get them moving. So
1:18:16
that's kind of the the certified enrollment. Um so we'll use those numbers moving forward budget budget
1:18:22
wise. Michelle and I already talked. We bring in Tim who you got to see again today. appreciate him. Like,
1:18:29
we're going to we're going to be able to talk about what DCG can still do. Down some kids to make sure our teachers and
1:18:34
staff get the appropriate dollars they deserve. We're still going to have to hire some people, right? The the high
1:18:41
school, for example, they they're still growing. They've got they've got more kids than than not over the next few
1:18:48
years. So, we're going to play that balancing act again uh to both take care of staff and add as necessary and be
1:18:55
fiscally responsible. So, questions maybe on enrollment before I keep
1:19:01
moving. Okay.
1:19:07
Bond information. Just to be brief, it's just a reminder to to those maybe watching at home. Excited to have the
1:19:13
bond forum tomorrow. So, we'll have the the board candidate form start at 6:00 in the auditorium. That'll go till 6:45,
1:19:19
but then 7 o'clock is the bond form. Certainly would love to have anyone in this room come. We've we've taken
1:19:25
questions we've got from our online submissions, questions we've heard on social media, just rever and AJ's done a
1:19:31
heck of a job kind of putting together uh a list of those questions. So, at the table tomorrow night, myself, um OPN
1:19:39
will be there to answer some questions. Michelle will kind of have some uh budget talk. Matt Blackmore will be
1:19:45
there to talk some of the high school programming things. Um Madison's going to be there to answer some activities
1:19:52
questions. Greg's got a role here. He's going to share some info. So I think we've got probably 15 18 questions and
1:19:59
we'll just have them up like we kind of did two years ago with some different topics and people will be able to share
1:20:05
out. But I think the vast majority of the questions have still the property tax question um which hopefully we've
1:20:13
we've been able to kind of tackle. But we'll keep answer we'll answer that again tomorrow night and um yeah just
1:20:19
just share a lot of the neat stuff that's come if our families um will have us say yes a week week from
1:20:27
tomorrow. It's crazy. I channel 13 was nice enough. They came in this morning.
1:20:32
So, if you're up really early at 5:00 a.m., you can see my ugly mug on there. Um, then KCCI is on Wednesday. So, we're
1:20:40
just trying to continue to get the the word out. But very optimistic. And I want to end this part with thanking the
1:20:47
community members that have been out and about knocking on doors, answering questions, putting up signs. Social
1:20:54
media this weekend and today had some more questions and they were very good about reaching out and clarifying. So,
1:21:00
you know, just very lucky with the the support we have in this community. So,
1:21:05
any bond question? I know that in the past that forum for the candidates was recorded and then
1:21:13
pushed out. Yes. Will this bond town hall also be recorded and pushed out and when do we
1:21:18
expect that to occur? Thanks, Nancy. Yep. We will be recording the the board forum and the bond forum.
1:21:24
AJ, do we think? Yep. So, we'll do it Tuesday night and it will be out the next day. Yep. So,
1:21:30
it'll be good. You bet. I'm going to jump because I got two fun things at the end. So, I'm going
1:21:35
to jump to superintendent goals. So, as I have my individual goals with you each
1:21:41
year of things that I want to tackle and improve on, this can be changed, added, adjusted, you know, what whatever you
1:21:48
all see best. But you know last year was really the strategic planning work and
1:21:55
kind of the OPN facility master planning work. So I thought it might be
1:22:01
appropriate that this year I focus on the initial implementation
1:22:07
of this work. So I put in here kind of a a plan with some outcomes on how we can
1:22:13
start implementing the strategic plan in this year and then for years to come what the communication will look like. I
1:22:19
meet with our senior leadership team um twice a month um in for you know about
1:22:25
an hour. It's a combination of some work time to collaborate with each other, but also some sharing out where are you on
1:22:31
this stuff. Um, you know, in in full honesty, there's a lot on there for year
1:22:36
one and and we're going to work diligently on there. We're we're not going to be able to tackle with fidelity
1:22:42
all of that. There's going to have to be some things that you know probably shift a little bit but um it's it's right now
1:22:49
kind of living on the senior leadership time so we can get some things off the ground and moving and then ultimately right goes to some principal or or
1:22:56
different directors down to the teaching level. So excited to watch that process kind of kind of phase out. So that and
1:23:04
then you know knock on wood hopefully in 8 days or so we're celebrating a bond
1:23:09
passing. So it'll be starting again the implementation of the facility master plan both from the bonding side but also
1:23:15
the other items that we still need to to tackle that are outside of of the bond
1:23:21
itself. So again, working with our directors, operations team, Michelle,
1:23:26
OPN, DCI, our construction management crew, being open with you all, our our
1:23:33
um our families, where's their money being spent, what's the progress of these projects, evaluating their
1:23:40
effectiveness. Um, so I kind of thought those two may still be appropriate with the implementation side and then my
1:23:46
summary was kind of like I I feel like both of these goals for me, you know, if
1:23:51
done well are going to strengthen our system. They they will impact staff and and kids for sure. Um, again, being
1:23:58
responsible with our dollars and cents, and certainly being open with all of you and our families, continue to build
1:24:03
build trust to say, "Hey, we're an open book and answer their questions." And then always looking at ways we can
1:24:10
improve when the um strategic plan is working great. When we're hitting some
1:24:16
hiccups, hey, what do we got to change to make better? Always being kind of reflective in in those items. So, with
1:24:22
that, I thought it'd be, you know, beat those up, give me different ideas, ask some questions. Uh, but those are my
1:24:29
kind of proposed items as we tackle the next six or seven months.
1:24:42
Any questions there? I appreciate the um measurable outcomes
1:24:48
listed. I think that that'll be really helpful when it comes to um you know evaluation
1:24:54
um but but having that broken out and showing that um not only is this just like lip
1:24:59
service on them you know cuz obviously hey these are my go whatever um but like no no here are the action items here are
1:25:06
the calls to action here's how you can see that I did do a b and c so great I appreciate that very much thank you
1:25:12
thanks Mike okay um wasn't on here but because I was
1:25:18
kind waiting for this weekend, but I want to highlight some of our activities from Madison before I finish with the
1:25:25
creator stuff. So, we've had as good of a a fall activity
1:25:31
season as I think any school can possibly have. So, just a couple of
1:25:36
highlights I want to make you aware of if you are not already. um first in the
1:25:41
fine arts side. Our marching band competed a couple weeks ago at state
1:25:46
competition walke and and were in the big class of course they got fourth which is just an incredible you you
1:25:52
probably are up in the morning seeing the lights on like they that group works as hard as any organization activity
1:25:59
we've got. So, incredible work by the band, which includes of course the the color guard, includes the conductors,
1:26:07
the the whole deal is it's amazing. Um, we had 28 students audition for All
1:26:14
State Music this past Saturday in Atlantic. 28's a large number to begin
1:26:19
with. We had 11 of the 28 be accepted, which it's not an infinite number of
1:26:25
people that make All State to have 11 is an incredible number. Um, so just super
1:26:31
proud of the whole 28 for putting themselves out there and the 11 again that get to represent BCG is extremely
1:26:38
exciting. Volleyball. So, we're going to go from bond forum and sprint to the gym because
1:26:47
volleyball um will be in their regional final against uh ADM starts at 7 tomorrow
1:26:53
night. Tickets can unbound. We did have um a sponsor pick up a hundred student
1:27:00
tickets. So, our students are able to go support our ladies volleyball. And
1:27:05
again, the first hundred will because it's a state event, right? So, their passes don't work. So, that number was
1:27:12
picked up and I think that's I mean that's eight or 10 bucks a pop. So, someone picked that up and
1:27:18
remains anonymous. They're great and so love to see you all there and the kids there. That's going to be great. So,
1:27:24
they would play next week at state. Uh, cross country, both boys and girls qualified for state, to be honest.
1:27:31
That's kind of it. It is what it is. That's just what these two teams do. They're always in the state competition.
1:27:37
They're always competing for championships. They're incredible. So, that is um Saturday up in Fort Dodge.
1:27:43
So, they'll run there. Um so, good luck to them. And then, uh football team had
1:27:49
a fantastic season for the first time in the biggest class. uh 10th in the rankings how they do it. So they will
1:27:55
travel to Sous City East on Friday. Um sponsors came in and picked up uh a
1:28:02
charter bus actually for them so our kids can go on that. And right now the plan Madison is working uh to find you
1:28:09
know a chaperon or two and we are offering a pet bus for those students that would like to jump on and and
1:28:14
travel to Sous City East to cheer on the football team. So, as we sit at the end of October to celebrate,
1:28:21
you know, homecoming, our fine arts, our athletics, I mean, DCG
1:28:27
is doing incredible things, which you all know. And again, 7th through 12th grade, we just highlighted the high school, but seventh grade activities,
1:28:33
had a great fall, and we're talking 85 plus% student involvement in those
1:28:38
things. And that's We didn't even get into some of the clubs. We didn't talk yet about esports and we're getting to
1:28:45
Oh, I want to mention the musical is a week uh not this coming weekend but the next week. Wizard of Oz. AJ and I were
1:28:52
there taking pictures with them last week in all their costumes and Fred has taken over that that role this year. I
1:28:58
mean they're topnotch. So please, please go support the musical next Friday,
1:29:04
Saturday, and Sunday as well. So don't forget golf. Golf. Thank you. How do I not have that my kids on the
1:29:10
golf team? forget about that. Uh golf made the state for the first time in in 20 or so years again in the big class.
1:29:17
Performed incredibly well. Uh we had one one of our players in the top 10. I mean
1:29:23
just again spoiled two of them. Thank you. I missed one. Yep. So
1:29:30
awesome stuff. Last but not least, you see the list of crater that uh last Monday Carrie AJ and I went around
1:29:36
surprised all of these staff members. Um, my favorite thing when I see the
1:29:41
list come in is a they're from their colleagues, right? Their their teacher friends, their associates, their
1:29:47
custodians, their principal. These are all nominated by their colleagues and peers and they celebrate them. So, we
1:29:55
give them this award with the writtenout statement that their colleagues shared about them. Here's why want, you know,
1:30:02
Britney to win this award, which is super cool uh to give to them. Number two is I love the mix, right? There's a
1:30:09
whole lot of different positions that get recognized by different positions. Um, not just maybe
1:30:17
their their like position. So, just want you to have that list. It's fun to go
1:30:22
around and celebrate these people. And so much fun. I have one that I get to do
1:30:28
here. So, I need my good friend Michelle Wormouth to stand up.
1:30:36
[Music] [Applause] She does she does not know this was
1:30:41
coming as you can tell by her I hope you don't meet your goals and get fired face.
1:30:49
Yes. Okay. So, I'm going to read this. DCG
1:30:54
creator Michelle Wormouth. This was nominated by Ashton Rees who is one of our curriculum facilitators. Um, these
1:31:02
awards are that we asked the staff to pick one of our our core values that you all helped us work on. So, she said, uh,
1:31:07
collaborative. Michelle holds one of the most challenging roles at DCG, often making difficult decisions, yet she
1:31:14
consistently keeps students best interest at the center of her work. She has been both collaborative and
1:31:19
supportive in working with me to ensure the music team moves forward with consistency in areas such as inventory,
1:31:25
purchases, and instrumental fees. While she carefully follows the law in every decision, she also makes certain her
1:31:31
choices remain fair and accessible for all of DCG students. My favorite line,
1:31:37
though she may project a tough exterior, her leadership reflects a deep
1:31:42
commitment to equity, integrity, and care for both staff and students. So,
1:31:48
what we give to all of our creators is they get this neat certificate. They have a fun little magnet that they get
1:31:54
to put proudly in their classroom, in their office. So, if we can celebrate the talented Michelle
1:32:11
actually
1:32:26
you're not going to get paid again till 27.
1:32:34
Yeah. So, okay. Thanks for letting me have a little fun with there at the end, but any questions for me?
1:32:42
Okay, thank you very much. Um,
1:32:51
better do that first.
1:32:56
She's a creator, Ryan. We're not allowed to skip her anymore. Miss Wearmouth, please. Yeah. Now that I'm all over clumped, uh, we will be
1:33:03
doing the P public budget comparison. Um, this is the first time you've seen
1:33:08
this this year. If you remember, public budget comparison report is the four areas that you promised to the public
1:33:14
what you would spend in each of those specific areas across all funds. And if
1:33:20
you look at the percentage of expenditures to the amounts published, you'll see that the only one running a
1:33:25
little hot and heavy is the support services area. That would be most of our operations, our building operations,
1:33:31
things that occur during the summer, which makes sense because a lot of that work is performed in July and August
1:33:37
getting ready for the new school year. So, uh, as we move through the year, we will continue to monitor that area to
1:33:44
see if it's still going to run at that pace or if it slows down. But once again, this is so the board can take
1:33:50
action to amend a budget if necessary. So, do you have any questions about the public budget comparison report?
1:33:58
Okay, moving forward, uh we're going to talk about uh the limited English
1:34:04
proficiency program and uh allowable costs and a request to the school budget
1:34:09
review committee. Annually, all school districts may request uh modified
1:34:14
supplemental authority or MSA to the school budget review committee for any costs in excess of what they were
1:34:21
actually funded for their LEAP or their limited English profic proficiency program. Um the calculation for our
1:34:29
school district, uh we had expenditures of 328,000 serving those students in the program
1:34:36
and resources of $212,000. And so, uh, we have the opportunity to
1:34:43
submit a request to the school budget review committee for $115,291.15.
1:34:50
That will be presented to you in um, new business tonight. If you wish to move
1:34:56
forward and take that action, remember what you are requesting is authority. It's not actual cash. Do you have any
1:35:02
questions about that? I I do. Um, how is
1:35:10
this money trickling down from above federally? Um, I know that with the government shutdown and changes to the
1:35:17
department of ed, specifically title three funding, which I believe applies to this subgroup.
1:35:22
So, title three, uh, the portion of title three that is dispersed at the state level, this is looking back at
1:35:29
last year. So, this funding would be there. Um, as far as title three
1:35:34
subgrants, our district hasn't had one for three years now, two or three years now. So, that isn't a direct impact that
1:35:43
I expect this year. As far as the 2526 school year, I have received no
1:35:50
information that says we will not be fully funded for any deficit or uh change in resources for this coming
1:35:58
year. Yep.
1:36:03
Okay, finally, it's that exciting time of year uh where we get to review the audit. The great thing about this is our
1:36:10
auditors fully understood that our uh district would go to a election vote, a
1:36:17
bond election vote on November 4th and understood the very constrained timeline
1:36:22
should we want to sell bonds in the 2025 school year. And so I have to applaud
1:36:29
Bergen KDV Creative Planning who are our auditors out of Minnesota and
1:36:34
specifically Dustin Opad's uh who resides uh in the wrong school district
1:36:40
just over the hill. um uh but his willingness to have his team put in long
1:36:46
hours to get our audit done so quickly and have you review and approve it in
1:36:52
October so that we are ready uh should timing allow us and should the voters
1:36:57
allow us to go forward with a bond sale, we have all of our financials thoroughly
1:37:03
in order. So, I'm going to take you through a brief skip through the 25
1:37:08
school year. This will be the last time that I take you back in time to FY25.
1:37:13
And then as always, any questions you have, you can stop me or we can visit later. The audit is a big document. And
1:37:20
so my encouragement to you is to not only look at the financial statements,
1:37:27
but look at that communication letter that's been provided to you by the auditors um to kind of help you
1:37:34
understand what the fiscal year in review looked like. With that said, as you look at the
1:37:40
financial statements, the management's discussion and analysis is found on page 7 through 19. It is an executive
1:37:47
summary, a synopsis of the year written by district management and uh contains a
1:37:54
good portion of the data that you would want to review beyond that communications letter. Specifically, on
1:38:02
page 22, you'll find the statement of net position. This is a full acral statement and typical of what we would
1:38:08
normally see in a business financial statement. Sometimes it's a bit bit misleading because we're not a business,
1:38:14
we're a government, but it contains all debt and all fixed asset values in that statement. Uh all funds with the
1:38:21
exception of the proprietary funds, those funds are the farm enterprise and the nutrition funds appear under the
1:38:27
section called governmental activities. Farm and nutrition appear under business type activities. None of the component
1:38:35
units such as the athletic boosters or FOA are included in these financials.
1:38:41
On page 23, that is called the statement of activities and it lumps all the funds
1:38:47
into an expense column and compares them to revenues. It shows what constituents
1:38:52
pay for their services under charges for services. And that page is split horizontally by government and business
1:38:59
type activities. Near the bottom, you'll notice it breaks down property tax and local option sales tax revenues.
1:39:06
Finally, uh the one that makes the most sense to me would be uh page 24, the
1:39:11
balance sheet for all funds. Looking specifically at the general fund unassigned fund balance, you'll see on
1:39:18
that exhibit 9,922,878.
1:39:24
That's an increase over the previous year's $ 8.5 million of about $1.4 4
1:39:29
million. Our cash reserve levy for that year is $949,000.
1:39:35
So this makes sense. Typically we spend a good portion of our cash reserve on increased enrollment and increased
1:39:41
enrollment was not something we saw in the last fiscal year. So most of that cash was applied back to fund balance.
1:39:49
Uh, also on this report, non- major special revenue funds such as the activity fund number 21 is listed there,
1:39:56
but it is further broken down into detail for you on pages 70 through 72.
1:40:02
Also, the capital projects uh are broken down on page 6, 68, and 69, and those
1:40:08
would be the save and the ple funds. Um looking forward into the report,
1:40:14
you'll notice that uh the enterprise funds are propri or enterprise funds um
1:40:19
self-funded insurance internal service funds are listed uh there.
1:40:25
Um health employee health insurance uh the self-funded fund there and also the
1:40:30
employee flexible benefits funds are there as the internal service funds. And
1:40:36
then finally, further to break down on page 63 through 65, you can see the
1:40:42
district's other postmployment benefits liability breakdown. That's $555,736
1:40:50
or 2% of payroll for its OP obligation. So if we were to close the doors, that
1:40:56
would be the other postemployment benefits that would be due payable after the fiscal year. It's just a good margin
1:41:04
to look at what percent of penage of payroll is your oped and 2% is a very
1:41:11
reasonable number for that. Uh exhibit D uh or on page 27 is simply
1:41:19
a table that reconciles uh page 22 which is the statement of net position and
1:41:25
page 24 which is the balance sheet. So it takes it from governmental accounting
1:41:31
to business type accounting and this table brings them together to show you uh how they reconcile together.
1:41:39
On page 28 uh you'll find the combined statement of revenues, expenditures and
1:41:45
changes in fund balance. From this table, you can obtain the total revenue figure for the year and use it to
1:41:52
calculate solveny ratio, which as you recall is a measurement of financial health for the school district. Our
1:41:58
revenue figure is $49,190,000. And when we take AA flowth through out
1:42:05
of that figure and uh divide that by our fund balance, we come up with a solveny ratio of 20%. This is a very extremely
1:42:14
healthy fund balance. uh 20% looking into a period of time when we're about
1:42:19
to go to the bond market. This will reflect uh very positively in the eyes
1:42:25
of an S&P or a Moody's as they look at that.
1:42:31
Um, on page 33, this is just an exhibit that gives you
1:42:38
an example of the proprietary enterprise hot lunch fund, the nutrition fund, and
1:42:44
how it would function if we did not have state and federal government dollars to
1:42:49
support that program. It would have had a deficit of $738,000.
1:42:54
So, it's really important for the board to understand that not only are we funded for free students, for reduced
1:43:01
students who meet those status qualifications, but all paid students receive a portion of funding for every
1:43:07
meal claimed through that uh program with both state and federal dollars.
1:43:13
Um, in notes to financial statements, I'm going to point out just a couple things in those notes to financial
1:43:19
statements. capital asset depreciation cycle and the value limits that we've sent are on page uh set are on page 32.
1:43:28
Our investments and risks are covered on page 39. Our capital asset activity for the
1:43:34
fiscal year is covered on page 43. And most importantly for this board, debt
1:43:40
service liabilities, long-term liabilities are listed on page 44 and 45, noting that you have about $75
1:43:48
million in current existing debt, $74,843 242.
1:43:55
Uh that's general obligation debt outstanding at the close of the fiscal year. We also have one revenue bond uh
1:44:02
liability on page 45 and it is just over $5 million outstanding at this point in
1:44:09
time. Uh the pension disclosure also appears in these statements on page 46
1:44:15
through 54. Once again noting our net pension liability as an actuarial value
1:44:21
of $1.1 million. Page 54 discusses tax abatements by each
1:44:27
of the cities within the district and the amount of property tax revenues that are reduced by those tax abatement
1:44:34
agreements. On page 55, we review the categorical funding
1:44:40
balance at the close of the fiscal year. An example of a categorical funding would be uh the TLC program that funds
1:44:47
teachers in our district. And when we don't fully expend uh it becomes a carryover balance and we determine at
1:44:54
that juncture what we will do with those funds and spend down that carryover.
1:45:00
Um finally a new note added um is note 13 which reviews the changes and funding
1:45:08
for the Aeas. Uh so you'll find that um I believe on page 55 as well
1:45:15
on page 76 and 77 property taxes amounts collected by year are reviewed and mill
1:45:22
rates for each exp extensive year are not listed but I point out that 2025 was
1:45:28
1871 2024 was 18123 was 1876. So you will see our district's
1:45:36
need continually hovering right in around that age that range and moving
1:45:41
back and forth as we implement cash reserve as needed.
1:45:46
Um this is also a really nice way to look at the table of federal and state aid comparisons in each fiscal year if
1:45:52
you just want a snapshot of what that looks like. Um for federal funding in the school
1:45:58
year, the district did surpass $750,000, which makes us eligible for single audit
1:46:05
this year. Uh the two pieces of federal funding that were selected for single audit were uh the safety grant or SLFRF
1:46:14
grant which was completed within the fiscal year and also the nutrition fund. This is a separate report not included
1:46:21
in your audit this year which is new and that is because uh because of changes at
1:46:26
the federal level. The new format required for that has not been dispersed to uh auditors, state auditors and local
1:46:34
auditors as of yet. And so our auditors have decided to issue that as a separate
1:46:40
report subsequent just because of our need to have financial statements out quickly. Um so we really appreciate
1:46:46
their work there. And finally um in the comments section which every board
1:46:52
member should review thoroughly talks about each of the findings of our school district. You will find that we have one
1:47:00
significant finding. It is the same finding that we have had for multiple years which includes segregation of
1:47:06
duties. Segregation of duties. We have made some significant efforts to try to
1:47:12
mitigate risks and make some changes uh to implement internal controls in
1:47:17
various areas. Unfortunately, as you read in the comment, this may never be
1:47:22
something that is fully achieved by the district because staffing it to achieve segregation of duties would be far more
1:47:30
costly than weathering the risks. So, I believe you will have that comment uh
1:47:37
for some time, but we're going to continue to work to make improvements in that area and add additional internal
1:47:43
controls. Uh, I want to point out that this audit finds no significant deficiencies, uh,
1:47:50
no non-compliance in federal awards, no questionable expenditures, no questionable travel expenses, um, no
1:47:57
other statutory findings related to its statutory reporting and uh, expenditures uh, did not exceed
1:48:05
public uh, limits. Um, so the only other comment is with regard to certified
1:48:12
enrollment, there were 3.2 26 uh students changed in the certified
1:48:17
enrollment area. I will note to you that that is a process dependent on the input
1:48:23
of many other districts and having their uh inputs correct which then
1:48:29
subsequently impact us. So I tried to fight and say don't put that in. It's
1:48:35
not our fault but I lost. So finally uh
1:48:40
this audit is a unmodified unqualified opinion and someone says what does that
1:48:46
mean? That that means it's good that's a good clean audit which is what you want to see. So with that said uh I have now
1:48:55
uh provided you with information to perform your fiduciary responsibility of review of the financials of the school
1:49:01
district for the fiscal year. What questions do you have and what data can I bring to you later?
1:49:10
I don't have questions. I just want to say thanks. You do a great job. I think
1:49:16
this is um a lot of districts would like to
1:49:22
have an audit like this and so appreciate all the work that you do and I know it's not just you, it's your team as well. Um but you do a fantastic job
1:49:30
and thanks for taking such good care of the district financially. We appreciate it very much.
1:49:36
Thank you all,
1:49:46
Monica. Um, I just want to take a quick minute to say that I spent I took some time off
1:49:52
work last week and I went on a school building tour with Dr. Bloom. Um, we
1:49:58
went to Oak View, South Prairie, Northridge, and the high school in the middle of the day. And it was just so
1:50:04
fun and cool to see everyone in their environments. Nobody had any idea we were showing up. So, we just popped into
1:50:10
the buildings and teachers were super welcoming. Um, got to go into the classrooms and see what kids were doing.
1:50:17
Um, it's just really fun to see kids learning in different environments and um, two of the classrooms we went into
1:50:23
were taking tests and I really wish when I was in high school I could have taken a test like that. Like the lights were
1:50:29
dimmed, it was cozy, like it was just really fun and it especially to get to see kids in, you know, the different
1:50:35
pods and areas throughout the building learning and working together. Um, and Northridge
1:50:42
got to see Mrs. Kaitlyn was hanging out in the hallway with a kiddo who was having a tough time and needed a break.
1:50:47
So, she was sitting on the floor in the hallway playing cards of him and letting him know how many more minutes of his break he had. So, it was just really
1:50:54
awesome to see the cool things going on and especially when they're unannounced visits. Um, you know, nothing is
1:51:01
prepared and they don't know that you're coming. And so, it was really, really fun. And just shout out to all of the
1:51:07
teachers, associates, everyone that we saw. Um, you are all doing an amazing job and keep up the great work. And Dr.
1:51:13
Bloom also uh has another name if you ever want to call him Mr. Moon. There's
1:51:18
a child at South Prairie who expects him to be there every day for math and calls you Mr. Moon. So you can also call him
1:51:24
Mr. Moon. Every day Mrs. Rance kind of lets me know that my man is looking for my math
1:51:31
help. When's Mr. Moon coming back? So, I don't know where that came from, but
1:51:37
would love to again if anyone I know you got busy schedules, but if there's a way I can walk you around, um would love to
1:51:43
do it. It was it was fun to see all the staff doing things. I think one of my highlights with Monica, too, is when we
1:51:48
were in the elementary buildings, the number of kids that were in different rooms from their
1:51:55
teacher because they're splitting up math and we're moving kids around because when reading literacy groups
1:52:01
were meeting, I'll take this group. So kids were moving a lot in between
1:52:06
classrooms, which was super cool. And we had a plan to go to all buildings. Monica got really chatty with people, so
1:52:15
we couldn't. I promise I wasn't the problem, right? That did not keep us on track. But
1:52:22
we also got to see our own kiddos, which was super fun because my son's entire baseball team was having lunch together,
1:52:27
and so I threatened some pictures, but did not happen. But I at least got to sneak one picture with him. But that was
1:52:33
fun. I went into DJ's class Spanish and what did we hear? Hey, your dad's there. And
1:52:39
is that your mom? Actually, I think we should address this. Yeah. So,
1:52:45
second grader asked if I was his wife or his girlfriend. Yep. So, it got the kids. They don't no
1:52:51
filter. But a lot of fun celebrating staff. And so, if I can do that for anybody, just holler and we'll go check
1:52:57
it out. Thanks for sharing, Monica. Thank you. Uh we'll move along to item
