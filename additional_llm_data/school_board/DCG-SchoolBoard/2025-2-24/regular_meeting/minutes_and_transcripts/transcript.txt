good evening my name is Tara mcaffrey my husband and I live in Dallas Center with
our two children I am in my ninth year of teaching and sixth year of teaching at South Prairie Elementary we love
being a part of the dcg family I'm here tonight to express my concerns reg
regarding the current decline in enrollment our school's mission is to empower all students to take charge of
their future I'm here to be the voice of our students whom the decline in enrollment is currently impacting our
District's mission is not merely a statement it reflects our commitment to fostering an environment where every
child can Thrive academically socially and emotionally due to a decline in
enrollment Dallas Center Elementary will only have one section each for kindergarten 1 and possibly second grade
next year this reduction in the number of sections will limit the number of students able to attend Dallas Center
Elementary because once a class exceeds the maximum class size new students will be sent to Grimes Elementary buildings
or families will choose to open enroll in other districts unfortunately this is
already occurring and multiple students have been sent to Grimes with the potential of more as students continue
to enroll as some of you may know Dallas
Center Elementary is in the top three elementary schools in the state according to the Iowa school performance profile
we need to be proactive in ensuring that Dallas Center Elementary remains a strong thriving top tier elementary
school that not only meets the needs of our current families but also attracts new ones if we continue down the path of
transferring families to larger elementary schools or Turning Away prospective students we risk further
diminishing enrollment this could eventually lead to the closure of Dallas Center Elementary which would be
devastating for our students teachers and the community at Large I invite the school board and the administration to
explore options to increase enrollment and make Dallas Center Elementary a destination school one that families
from neighboring districts seek out as their first choice together key stakeholders can
explore innovative solutions that can enhance the school's offerings promote its unique advantages Market its
exceptional school performance and experiences and create an environment that appeals to both current and
potential families by leveraging our strengths and thinking creatively we can
compete with and ideally surpass our neighboring districts in enrollment let's not wait until it's too late the
future of Dallas Center Grimes Community School District depends on our willingness to act now I ask you to consider this
invitation and encourage the school board and District leadership to take the next steps to ensure that every
school in our district continues to thrive and remain essential parts of our two communities empowering all students
to take charge of their future for years to come thank
you thank you um may I call Leslie Earl back
please thank you good evening I'm lesie earlbeck and I live in Grimes Iowa I am
the mom of of a kindergartener and second grader at Dallas Center Elementary first board members and
School administration thank you for your service and commitment to our school district in part we are as great as we
are because of the work you have done and continue to do on behalf of our kids and the
schools I want to speak tonight in favor of the school administration working directly with dce staff to create a a
short and long-term solution which is favorable to the district as a whole to
be clear I didn't go to school to be an educator nor do I have years of teaching
or School administration experience I'm a chief operating officer of a public
agency in the Metro who has spent most of my career in strategic planning
strategic Communications and the establishment and sustain sustainment of
a positive and high performing workplace culture i waffled in my desire to speak
with you tonight but ultimately decided to be here for two reasons one I feared that without me speaking it would be
assumed that the conversation and decision making at hand doesn't impact my children and it does the way I view
it there is certainly an impact on a macro level and it's possible there's an impact on a micro level
too on the macro level the kids go to school every day where there's an established culture the dce staff are
supportive of one another they're collaborative they communicate well they celebrate together they rally around one
another to solve problems they're a community and it is centered around the children and helping their peers achieve
success the success has led to the school to achieve a top three ranking in the state an environment that lacks a
plan leads to anxiousness self-doubt and an overall distraction from the core Mission without a plan these factors
will ultimately lead to a less desirable culture on a micro level my kindergarten
could be one of the kidss next year who's transferred to a Grime School of course that would affect her and her
sister since they go to school together it's quite possible that my children won't be impacted on a micro level but
it's estimated that at least three children will be relocated in the end I
felt a need to highlight this impact regardless if the impacted child is my own or another the second reason I
elected to speak tonight is in regards to the importance of a plan I absolutely
do not believe it's in the intention of anyone in this room to close dce however
I do believe that an absence of a plan or in action that is in fact action
which will consequently lead to either the closure of dce or a fall from its current Statewide standings that we are
all so proud of at The Forum Dr Bloom shared the greatest indicator of a children's
success is our great teachers and I agree I believe in large part the school
has navigated the challenges of one section classes the past two years because of the positive culture I
previously mentioned as well as the extensive years of experience the teachers possessed which positioned them
well to Mentor the mentees I anticipate that in absence of a short-term and
long-term plan we are at risk of losing these highly qualified teachers as well
as at risk for the deteriation of the positive culture from experience it is
much easier to sustain a top standing position than it is to rebuild I highly
encourage the development of a plan to ensure that we don't put these factors in Jeopardy trust is the foundation for
a positive culture and trust is created with not only open and honest dialogue
but with the formation of a plan in closing I want to acknowledge that many
of the challenges or opportunities the district is facing were not created by those in this room we have arrived by a
culmination of fact doors including the state legislature therefore it will require
many from within this room and outside of this room to solve this together the
best Solutions come from those who are passionate from those who are in a variety of positions both on the front
lines and leadership as well as constituents and outside resources at a
time when resources are lacking I not only come to you today to ask the board and administration for help but to offer
my help as well than thank you for your time tonight and your ongoing service to our community and to prove that I would
be willing to help I'm going to leave my business cards behind in case anybody would like to grab one I'd love to talk further thank you so much for your time
thank you um may I call Tanya
Foster hi my name is Tanya Foster um I am an Adele resident but also would be
in the WCB School District um I have been in the DCd school district for
seven years I currently have two children in the school system right now and I have a soon Tobe three-year-old
who will start three-year-old preschool in the fall I am here as a mom to tell my story and how this affects me by
limiting the dcg enrollment at the elementary school um in dela Center this
is just my story and how it affects me but I know there's a lot of people who can't be here tonight who don't feel
like they can speak so that's what I'm here for um when moving to Dallas Center in 2018 my daughter was placed at Dallas
Center Elementary School she was able to meet her peers her friends there and everyone who lived in close proximity
she was able to make those friendships um we were able to get together with those families create Community not just
for her but for ourselves um and she has continued those relationships and she's going into High School this year it
truly takes a village by moving our support system wider um this makes a negative impact not just for myself I
live 30 minutes outside of the school and I choose to drive each day to come here not only to bring my daughter to
school but to also be a part of this amazing District um when searching for a
new home we made sure to stay within the Dallas Center Elementary School so we could open and roll um we also chose our
daycare providers in that area so we were able um to keep everyone in the
same area um when we decided my daughter had to go to Oakview we then moved my son to
the voyage at Grimes because they provide a in part
built-in um three-year-old preschool which a lot of places don't my husband
and I work full-time so we do not have the luxury of doing before and after pickup unless we have before and after
care um it was actually really difficult to find the daycares in Grimes who were not full or had a waiting list or had
before and after care um and it was almost impossible to find someone to pick up your child during that halfday
preschool um now my children we were told when we were in Grimes that all of
the people open and rolling would be going to Dallas Center and elementary school so we picked up all of our kids
we took them the kids corner and that's where they're at right now I have a four-year-old in preschool who will go to kindergarten next fall or this fall
um and so my concern with that is that he won't be close most of the friends if
he is going back and forth between Grimes um I also have some concerns about how are we getting them are we
busing people who are they busing with are we adding more bus drivers instead of a teacher are they being supervised I
know we have a lot of seat belt concerns with these younger children um so I have
a concern as a mom just safety wise we busing people to and from um a town that
has an elementary school and the ability to hold another teacher um and I feel like were kind of creating unnecessary
risk of just being on a bus
um adding um staying with current classmates and being able to have
competent before and after care for my kids and other people's kids is really just kind of what we want as parents we
want to make sure our kids are safe and that they're taken care of and that there is a spot for them um so please
help our kids um be able to make this big transition from kindergarten and support
the families who want to see our town grow allow others to come and visit this amazing District thank
you thank you like to call Brad
Davidson hello uh I am a father of a preschooler and a second grader at
dce and I just want to say our Dallas Center Elementary has an Incredible Gift to our community and children we feel
welcomed and heard and supported by each staff member our children adore their teachers Paris secretaries lunch ladies
and principal DC has won high achievement twice and they have done
this with fewer teachers resources and bigger class sizes than the most I
understand that class sizes are bit uh sorry I understand that funds are tight I really do I get it you can't just get
money out of nowhere but we got to come up with Creative Solutions either by asking teachers to move or if
open enrollment students want to come to dce we just got to come up with
something our children deserve the best we need to invest in our community we are small but
growing we all know it is much easier to maintain a teacher and staff than it is
to come up with funding for
new so and we know if we don't come up with
something now we'll end up with one section of each grade if we're not careful and that goes down a slippery
slope of only having to eventually coming up with the idea that it's
cheaper to bus students than it is to hire new staff and eventually that'll lead to possible closing of the school
which has happened all over the state I personally seen it so just remember
when the frustration and the stress and all this has caused remember next midterm elections
why we have budget shortfalls now thank you very
much thank you I'd like to call Amy
strut hi everyone my name is Amy strut and I live in Dallas CER with my husband
and our two daughters a kindergartener and a third grader at Dallas Center Elementary so I'm here to reiterate a
lot of what you've already heard I'll keep it brief and add in a little bit of a new element for you um because I also
serve on the Dallas Center City Council and I'm here tonight as both a parents
and a city representative to support dce um my family is also a part of the
larger dcg Community I have a niece and a nephew who live in Grimes and they are
students at Oakview and at the high school so I see firsthand how our communities and schools are
interconnected and how important it is that every school in our district remains strong so first and foremost
thank you to all of you board members and administrators um truly the service
that you provide to our students and our community is is above and beyond we can
tell how much you care I personally appreciate the work you do to make dcg a great place for
students teachers and families thank you and second I am here to ask your support
and creating the ad hoc committee focused on attracting and retaining teachers and students at
dce this will benefit the entire district with increased enrollment now um as you know dce is an
asset to our district you've heard a lot about and and know firsthand about how it's been
recognized as one of the top performing schools in the state um and this ranking reflects the dedication of the Educators
staff and families at DC we need to ensure that we can continue to recruit
and retain top Educators and attract families who want their children to attend such a high quality School in
such a high quality District um now from a city perspective delis Center is growing we have multiple
new developments in works and those developments include plans for more
affordable housing options that will are designed to attract young
families as a member of city council I'm committed to working alongside all of
you and as the school district however I can to support dce and the larger dcg
Community once again I strongly encourage you to support the creation of this committee this is a crucial step in
ensuring the continued success of dce its role within our growing community
and increasing overall enrollment numbers to benefit the district as a whole thank you so much again for your
service for your time your consideration and for all you do for dcg you are
appreciated thank you like to call Megan Bennett
good evening my name is Megan Bennett and I from murn um nine years ago we
bought our house in murn and my husband is a former uh dcg Alum so we chose to
open en roll our son into dcg 9 years ago at that time we were told that he
would go to dce because of open enrollment which we were completely fine
with um he is now at Oak viiew and we have gone through Sports and everything
and along the way we have another son who is now in the preschool system through you guys and we did the
three-year-old preschool here in Grimes last year at Heritage and I was lucky enough to have a family member who was
able to pick my son up and drop him off um at the end of the year unfortunately
she was no longer able to do that my husband and I both work full-time um so at that point in time we made the
decision um knowing that he was was going to be in four-year-old preschool and then open and roll into kindergarten
we wanted to move him to Dallas Center to Kids Corner as knowing that he would
be going to Dallas Center Elementary and we thought okay we keep him at Heritage
then he's not going to go to school with kids that he knows so we decided to move him to uh Kids Corner at that point in
time and he is in the four-year-old preschool there and um so he would be
planning to go to Dall Center Elementary next year with that being said and going to Kids
Corner we also have before and after school care through them um we were given I was told that we would would
have first dibs to go for the before and after school program um that is my main
concern now knowing that possibly being busing him into Grimes next year that we
would not have before and after school care um I know that those are a high
stake thing um because a lot of parents work and I get it and but the kids that
are already there already have first dibs along with their siblings that are coming in so at that point in time that
would leave us without before and after school care um we love the district we've been with the district for like I
said nine years my son plays football and he's in show choir and everything so
we're we are full on dcg family in mimber so but I just would like for
everybody to take into account that you know there are families especially even open enrolled families that you know
want to be a part of this District even though we're not in the district and we appreciate everything you guys do for
our kids and taking care of them and we just want to see Dallas Center grow and
continue to be an excellent school so thank you for your time thank
you uh we'll move along uh to the agenda Dr Bloom any changes for the agenda yes

Grant uh application good evening everyone I'm
honored to be here tonight with these three um ladies behind me my name is April heightland I'm the building
principal at Northridge Elementary and we are going to talk to you tonight
about countdown to
kindergarten so prior to covid we always had a parent night where families would
come in um and learn about kindergarten well Co happened and we had not brought
that back so we are bringing back countdown to kindergarten and we are are excited
about this opportunity to enhance communication between home and school
continue to build upon the school and family Partnerships one of the things that we
have done to help us is um with the help from AJ we did ask for feedback from our
current kindergarten families of information that they would like to have
prior to starting kindergarten we sent out 515 um surveys through parent Square we
between the four of us we got 32 responses back and we are using that
information to help build our presentations and ensure that our
families are getting the information that they need prior to starting
kindergarten I also have the opportunity and privilege to work um with Gina
Pierce who is our transitional kindergarten um teacher for the district
um optional this year we have moved to the transitional um name for next year
and Gina is partner partnering with the kindergarten teachers she has actually sent out a survey this year as part of
her personalized learning to our current kindergarten teachers asking information
of what they would like to see what ways that she can help she is also going to
be a part of the Northridge parent night she is also going to be present at the
South Prairie parent night um we did offer it to all um Deb and Diane are
going to just choose to any questions that come in they're going to funnel those through Gina Gina uses her
Wednesdays to reach out to parents and answer any questions she gives tours of
the buildings she meets oneon-one with parents that any that have any questions
regarding transitional kindergarten and then she also works side by side with our Preschool teachers to ensure that all of
our students that may be interested in trans transitional kindergarten are
getting that opportunity um we also open it up in the fall we give a kind of a two- week
window that if we have kids that start kindergarten and we're like the parents were like oh this was we needed to think
about the TR we should have done the transitional rout we do go ahead and bring them back in if there is room we
did do that this year um a couple of students from South Prairie um were able
to make that move over and then a student at Northridge was able to make that move over as well I think I'm
handing it off to Deb is that correct yeah well good evening and thanks for
being here my name is Deb kale I'm the principal at Dallas Center Elementary and I'm also the preschool director for
the district and for the last eight years I've had the wonderful opportunity of collaborating with these wonderful principles and we've tried to be more
alike than not as we collaborate to keep our buildings consistent so that's been really great so we're going to talk a
little bit tonight um about what a day in kindergarten is like but more importantly we'll do that in detail on
the night of our parent night so that we can introduce what kindergarten is like to ease any fears that the parents might
have um so here is a a sample schedule and mixed with all this um the teachers
really work a lot on the routines and expectations which Patty will talk about in a little bit they focus on social
emotional learning like how to share how to you know be kind to your classmates a
lot of students have preschool background so they come with that some do not but we just take them all and
love them and take them from where they are so this is just a sample schedule but we are consistent in how much time
we provide for the content areas for specials and for recesses so we do um
have that consistency between the buildings so if one student was to go from one building to the other they
would have the same type of opportunities that they have um from building to
building all right I think oh this is the video AJ do you want to do the
video hi my name is Sophie and I am in kindergarten at North gan
and we have a big day plan and we would love for you to join us W up today the
first part of my day is coming up with my classmates and my teacher we work
together to get your day started oh I don't know sometimes that's
group activities and playtime all leading up to your morning me reading
did you have a good weekend I'm focused on my reading skills lessons include
letter sounds reading words and site words these are words I need to memorize
like you look and drum we also spend time reading books sometimes my teacher
reads and sometimes I read on my own
currently my favorite book is about soccer next word word literacy rotations
are a big part of my morning let's look at question one that means I get reading
time with my teacher writing on my own and I watch stories on my
iPad after working hard on my reading it's my first brain break of the day I
get a few minutes for a class AC activity sometimes it's a song game or
dance good here we go break time is over and we have one more reading activity
before washing up for lunch we have 20 minutes in the lunchroom and then 25
minutes of recess after spending this time with my classmates we settle down
with quiet time this 15 minutes is for online stories and coloring raise your
hand how do I write 97 math is one of the main projects on my agenda this
afternoon counting dimes days in dogs is part of a typical lesson days of the
week of the week days of the week my teacher always has the next lesson ready
to go then we get to apply our learning this includes games with my classmates
and workplaces science and social studies are also part of the afternoon
in science we are learning about plants and animals and what they need to do to
survive currently we are studying forces and making our very own painball machine
our social studies lessons this year have focused on community history and
what's happening around us you can tell we've been working hard and we've earned
one more brain break before my teacher reads us a story and we get our
afternoon snack our afternoon writing lessons including opinion writing which
is based on what we think and feel in kindergarten we also get to have five
special classes PE guidance Library art
and music we've visit each class once or twice a week after specials we have one
more 20 minute recess to close out our day together thanks for following along
we might see you in a kindergarten classroom
soon so I'm Patty Morris and I'm the principal at South Prairie Elementary and as I was watching that which was a
Northridge student um I'm reminded it's it's so very similar I mean everything that she's talking about that's the same
things that we're doing we're doing the pinball machines we just did finish those and I think that's the great thing about the consisteny that we have and
like we said I I truly love working alongside these um other Elementary principles and I think we really do try
to collaborate and um we've been working really hard on the parent registration
the parent night and we are we always share all of our PowerPoints what are you sharing with parents uh when we look
at that feedback and I think that video is something great that we can share with our incoming parents when you watch
that that's not how they come to us that wasn't that long ago when we first get
our students into kindergarten they don't have those routines established you could see that classroom I mean they
they know their stuff but when they come in there is so much for our students to learn they're coming from a halfday
environment U many of them I'm going to say at South Prairie probably about a third of my students have not been in
any any sort of preschool when they come in so you bring them all in bring them
in together and we spend a lot of our beginning teaching the the climate the culture the the routines the
expectations what it is like to be a kindergarten because it's going to set up the parameters for their future as
you saw in that video it's very academic our kindergarteners it's not the I think
about my kindergarten experience is nothing like that we did a letter a day and I mean I'm older than me most of
you and so um you know if you think back about yours and some of you I was in a
half day program even it's a lot and they're exhausted in the beginning but
one of the things that we did hear back from the parent surveys is that our parents wish they would have known more
about what are the expectations for our students what do they need to know coming in what can I do to help help
them be more prepared so I'm excited about we've been working together and collaborating these guyss they have lots
of great ideas along with our building um admin assistants are working to help
create some documents websites uh we're putting together some a a resource for
our our families that they can go and look at things so when you looked at that schedule which was the Dallas
Center Elementry schedule that's very similar to ours too but you think about it they've never eaten lunch at school
so we're teaching them how to eat lunch we're teaching them how to go through a line what you have to take how to go
outside and play all these routin everything they do is something new um
although they've been in preschool it's still a lot different than a full day kindergarten so that's some of the
things that we're working on and we do talk a lot about that and we really have been working on what can we do to make
that a be better experience and for our parents to be more prepared so we're excited about the registration the
parent what are we calling that parent information night can't remember
countdown to kindergarten so we're excited to have that time for us to really talk to our
parents and like I said creation of some of those things because what I know is
that in April when we have these meetings many of my parents won't have even don't even live in Grimes yet and
they will be moving here they will be coming or or they don't know that they should sign their kids up because it's their first child so I won't have them
all but by the creation of all these resources we can provide that to families at another time also so that's
a lot about the routines and what we
do oh it's slower then Diane Williamson principal at Heritage um so we are going
to have a parent night um most of us are going to hold our nights on April 24th
um Northridge is going to have theirs on April 21st AJ I know will help us put out some things once we get more of the
details we're still in the planning stages so you'll notice that there's some different times up there we've kind
of opted at Heritage to try to do two smaller sessions um we felt like we would like to have our people in smaller
groups than in a large group I think um Northridge is still having to meet and make some decisions and the other
buildings are going to just do six to 7 o' there'll be a little different flavor I think at each building even though we
will share very similar things when we um hold host our nights so parents will
come in um and spend time with the principes and we'll do a presentation and they'll drop the kids in the
classroom so we'll just get to just see how they do experiencing um maybe listening to a
story just some very simple kinds of things how they share materials at a table just if they can detach from Mom
and Dad easily if we have to support that a little bit um all of those kinds
of things so nothing too rigorous it's more just for them to see the building see meet their teachers see a classroom
and maybe be less afraid of coming into the building at a later
time what did I do I hit the wrong button
yikes thank you AJ Okay the other part we just wanted to um beef up our
communication and again we took um information from the survey and so April
will be meeting with the parent night and our secretaries have kind of put together 10 things that they think most
parents would want to know so they will leave that night um having some of that
information and we will also push it out to them through email because there's some links involved with that and then
in may we always just say welcome our families into the building thank you for
registering um we have our coaches right now instructional coaches who are going to be working on uh a web page some of
the parents are saying we just kind of want to know what is it that our kids need to know when they come to kindergarten so we'll talk about some of
the academic um prerequisite skills that they could have some Fine Motors some gross motor skills social emotional
pieces and our coaches are going to work together across the elementaries to kind of build something and then AJ's going
to help them put together kind of a web page that parents can all access again that'll be something consistent that
they can all go to from all of our buildings so um we'll see how that turns out I'm sure it'll be great um July we
always send out we um basic information to our families so it could include things like here's kind of what a
schedule might look like um this is how we communicate in the building the teachers send newsletters we have a
newsletter that comes out each Monday from our building we'll talk about some of the health and safety kinds of things
through the nurse's office well the very confusing drop off and pickup lines in
all the buildings we'll go out to them they want to know about lunch the menus and snacks and
then we'll H we'll do some handbook highlights um you know the party
invitations those kinds of things that we always um talk about at the beginning of the year and then August will be a
little bit of a repeat again because that will catch all of the kids in the building um new families to our
buildings and then our K4 population will get all of the information um we'll
let them know about openhouse parents Square again about the absences the the
school building hours when to drop off um how if you can walk your kid in on the first day what that looks and sounds
like um for our family so lots of different communication just sporadically and little doses because
there's a lot you know throughout the summer
so and just thank you for letting us come tonight and share that we're excited actually to be able to meet our
families coming in and if there's anyone have any questions for us we'd be happy to
answer I am just curious um so I think
your spot on kindergarten um in particular if it's your first child is just a really big change um one of the
things that I'm thinking of are the students that we have that are coming to our district out of Early Access and
that are pre-identified for preschool because of their um special education
needs and how do we work with those parents to potentially talk to them about the the power of the transitional
kindergarten program and offering that extra leg up I mean I know because of
covid we as a family decided to retain our child and repeat kindergarten um I know that you can't
repeat four-year-old preschool because of federal funding there are kids that desperately
need to be in those Early Child Ood programs but that might benefit from
having that extra year of that social instructional learning the rules the routines the H how do we talk to those
parents because I I know I didn't feel informed well um we are working on that
one of the things that we do um under the direction of Deb is that we have
transition meetings with all of our preschool families um that are set up before the end of the school year so we
do meet with them um and then I have also already been in contact with some
families whose students are in preschool this year they would like to consider
the transitional um program and so we have worked with them um this year and
we we are kind of enhancing that a little bit to try and make sure that
they do know all of their options so I do have a couple of we do have a couple of kiddos that are um going to do
transitional instead of going right into kindergarten and then repeating kindergarten again I will say in the
past too um from my experience when I was at the K K2 building um is that as
you know SDI minutes come out of that transitional half day right and so those are conversations that um I remember a
conversation with a parent when we looked at that and because they would have been out of their classroom they chose to do the full day kindergarten
because otherwise they're not with their peers right over 50% is removed from the
classroom is
there why is transitional kindergarten half
day would you like me to just stay up here for a little while no no I'm did thank you I'm sorry yeah no that's okay
we um actually um Mrs Pierce and I have been working this this um this school
year one of her or actually her personalized PD this year has been gathering information
regarding program transitional kindergarten programs in the in the area we've been working alongside Dr krenza
and Dr Bloom um I for the for for next
year we are still sticking with the halfday program I don't we are you're
learning more we're learning more and we're seeing what it is that our families need we did send out surveys to
um the last three years of families um both that were in Kinder current full
day kindergarten and that have used transitional kindergarten we've looked at that data and so we've got a lot of
information that um Mrs Pierce has been working through and is sharing with um
the three of us so I am excited about all of the work that she's done thank you
yeah just a plug to our PTO they always buy our sweat our um T-shirt for us every
year it was brought to the board to make it a full day program a few years ago too and at that time it was decided
financially it was not where we needed to go so that's why they're continuing to study it's it's you know looking in
that into the future but I couldn't remember what board members were on the board when that was brought to you it's
been three four years ago so I just know that there's a push
in the legislature to move to preschool to even being a full day model and for some kids that are those unique groups
it's a daycare for parents sometimes too well and that would be a prohibitive factor I mean we've heard parents speak
tonight about how important that wraparound care and coverage is and being able to plan for their families
and so I just think it's prudent to have that discussion while you're all here I mean we don't get all four of you at
once I know so thank you we love being together just yeah we'll come together
anytime thank you any other questions before I leave I want to share
that I am bringing my kindergarten to team to you next month we've been working with Dr Bloom we have um a
little bit we we are looking at piloting a program um we all kind of talked about
it my population is a little bit different I mentioned previously that um I when you look at the enrollment
numbers tonight and you see like my kindergarten numbers we were there
similarly last last year and I don't get too worked up about that because I this is my 11th year and I know that the
trend is that my families come I have families that will come later and so I don't get too nervous about that um so I
know I will have families coming in fact I know that I have families signing up two weeks prior to school starting and
so many of those families uh have not had preschool experience and so next
month when we come and I'm so excited I don't want to spoil and give you too much information but we're looking at uh
something some surrounding districts have done my kindergarten teachers have really been working on what's best for our students
um this goes back several years but I can name in the past three years the classroom teacher that maybe has gotten
a class that's not as a mixed group as the others um whether it's academics
behaviors or whatever we don't know a lot about these kids coming in and so we want to Pilot we're going to call it
Kickstart um Johnston did a jump start where they brought kids in didn't have
class list created yet because we feel there's a great benefit to getting to know our students a little bit in those
first few days before we create those so we can have a better mix of our students
so I'm not going to give you any more information because that's coming next month but I wanted to kind of just put
that in your mind and even though we talk about collaboration and we do a lot
we try to be consistent and do a lot of similar things but we still have to look at the needs of our individual buildings
so that's to come thank you thank you
all Adam oh there he
is hello my name is Adam Churchwell I'm one of the curriculum facilitators here at dcg uh I specifically support um
social stud studies PE Health fastbridge Panorama and then computer science as well which is why I'm here tonight um so
we are applying for as Jill mentioned a little bit ago we are applying for one of the Prairie Meadows um Community
betterment grants and we're looking specifically to purchase some indie spheral so I'm going to talk a little bit about that tonight so first just to
give you a little background knowledge about computer science here at dcg um again this is my second year and last
year we looked specifically and we got together with our K through six teachers
and 7 through 12's computer science teams that was a mixture of general education teachers um specialist
teachers some Librarians um just all across the district and our K through2
focus last year was basically conducting a standards audit to kind of assess where we were um with our coverage of
our computer science standards um the audit included those general education classroom teachers specialist classes
and then our specific computer science um courses uh we have computer science class in fifth and sixth grade uh we
have computers class taught in seventh grade and then our high school computer science courses offered
there so after that um our K through 5 team was a big part of our discussion
because our SE our excuse me our 6 through 12 standards are covered by those Standalone courses so we
identified a need to strengthen our algorithm and Pro programming component of the standards and most of everything
else was being covered in the classroom in K through 4 but that was the area that we felt we needed to do a little
bit more in so our elementary Librarians graciously offered to support this
effort and after some discussions with them earlier this year we thought we determined that the Indie spos would be
our best um would be our best options to meet our students needs so AJ's going to
play a quick one minute video about what those exactly are
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
cover cover
[Music]
all right so as you can see um pretty interactive pretty Hands-On um things
that we can put in our students students hands to get them to Lear oops to get them to learn learn a little bit more
about computer science when we looked at these the big reason that we Cho that our Librarians uh chose these was
because there is not another device that you have to use so you don't have to have an iPad to control them they're
mostly controlled there now at the end you did see that you could go a little farther um we are looking at the class
kit and that class kit also has some mats that go with it as well um so I'll
talk a little bit more about that in just a little bit but our teacher Librarians um Lacy cedrel uh Betsy
bajaro and Heather Roberts all thought that those would best meet their needs as well as the training on those
wouldn't be as much as some of the others so we thought that would be the best thing so our grant proposal um that
we've created uh provides in fos for our k through6 Librarians to enhance student
learning it supports coding problem solving creativity through Hands-On activities um the other thing that our
Librarians came up with is this could also be a checkout for classrooms if they're involved in any stem projects
collaboration or just need something else to do that would be another thing that they could use and this aligns with
our district goals for 20th century skills and Technology careers and the funding would cover devices teacher
training and C curriculum integration so our grant proposal is we
are going to be requesting six Indie SPO class packs that comes with 16 of those
little Indie spos that you saw in that video as well as some of the different mats that go with it this would provide
one pack per Elementary School um all four of our elementary schools hopefully we'll get one as well as the middle
school and then there would be one more for district checkup now we did have to kind of put a little caveat in there
that if it is not fully funded um we would focus our attention then on the K
through 4 so there is a possibility that we ask for this much money we only get
this much so then our Focus would go to our K through four classrooms because that is where the biggest need for those
Hands-On learning because fifth through sixth 7eventh and eth and 9th through 12 all have other materials with those
Standalone computer science classes so um I do have to say thank you to um the
LI teacher Librarians they were so gracious in saying yes let's do this whatever you I mean this is adding
things to their plate but they are excited about it and excited to get it into our students hands um also to
shanana olssen for helping me go through this and especially Michelle for going through and coming to her last week and
saying oh you have to present to the board on Monday so that's why I'm here and but but she was very helpful in
getting it all together and putting putting this grant together so um with your approval we'll be submitting this
later this week so any questions uh do board members get to
like try this out sure like just to could visit a library control quality
control situation yeah just to make sure they work okay okay cool
yeah I think it's really cool I also love that it's screen free I think that that's um yeah a great way to
integrate um computers without having a screen yep it does a lot with the
programming side and the coding side and that was just something it was something what that as we were talking as a k
through 4 team we were really struggling to come up with with a way to meet those standards because they're a little more
complex and these seem to uh meet those standards the best absolutely okay
wonderful all right thank you very much thank you appreciate it thanks Dr krenza all right good evening
board members um have a couple of uh upates that I'll walk you through some more quickly than others the first I
want to start with is just an update on professional development and certainly the winter weather has thrown us for a
bit of a loop in that so you can see we've done some shifting and um we're on schedule we're maintaining that you can
see what we've done with our Flex time those are flex days are for those groups that traditionally don't always get some
of that targeted PD so I've been really happy with u with those groups this year
and feel like uh those groups are happy as well with with the learning they're getting um I want to thank our
principals and our coaches because we combined then where we missed a building day we Combined District and building
which just meant that they had to kind of shorten content on both sides but have seemed to adjust well with that so
I'm thankful for those teams I do want to spend some time talking about 25 26 professional
development because this will be a question um that we're we're really working hard on this right now so um
that process started now probably gosh a month or more ago where we started really digging into what was going to be
coming up and what I want to highlight there are those bulleted points or numbered points some things that
dominoes that have had to fall first before we've really dug into the calendar is first was the adoption of
the 2526 calendar so thanks to the board and uh everybody our teacher quality
team who helped give input that really is the first Domino so we know uh the the skeleton as I would say of what
we're going to be doing we talked last year a lot about around this time surveying and how would
we know if our professional development was effective and I'm really proud to share that our teacher quality team dug
into that quite a bit um this year so I would say most of the Fall was spent
discussing how and in what ways Would We Gather feedback survey our certified and
our classified staff to understand what was the state their experience with professional development so you had two
attachments in there I'm not going to read through them that was I hopefully had time to be able to do that but some
highlights for us as I think you can see in there that um I'm going to say overwhelmingly but
in general while we had a good response rate so we had 117 respondents that's probably out of about 200 and some just
alow 200s so I feel like we got a good representation um some buildings more
than others but I think we got representation from every building um you also we put in there our percentages
by rooll so you can see we had some gened teachers special programs administrators support staff and oncore
teachers for the certified and then by building for classified so um what we
wanted to do ascertain and we had some I'm going to be honest we had some hits and we had some misses and um I'm
thankful for the feedback because number one uh feedback is the Breakfast of Champions I've told that to our staff at
at presentation um our successes I think people really found the time overwhelmingly to be valuable um I think
we struck the right chord with our every Wednesday um I just was at a conference
and I talked with a staff member from another state about their professional development and I about fell out of my
chair in that District in another state they only get two full day PDS a year
that's it and I'm I'm like whoa I'm taking a back because I know how much content we have to cover and the amount
of time so um as you can see the results very well some misses we had along the
way maybe more with our classified staff that's not a that is not a negative that is a um kind of sending both Mr jman and
myself back to the drawing board just to say hey how can we collect more feedback let's go a little bit deeper into their
um responses find out then how can we change our planning and and certainly he can speak to that as well but looking at
ways that we can form a steering committee with classified staff that can also help us plan because we want to
make sure that we're hearing from the teachers so what we'll start to do is we'll start to ask all of those groups
building leaders we'll ask our Flex groups to to identify what content do you want to learn about because then it
takes us over the summer to be able to identify who's the provider of that content sometimes it's ourselves
sometimes it's District leaders principles sometimes it's the let's take the nurses for example sometimes it's the nurses themselves so um all in all
to say um I'm proud of the survey that we've administered um we'll continue to gather feedback and I heard from a lot
of people on on every side of the issue but we tried to develop some questions that that would get at the heart of of
their experiences so that we could make them better then we had a we did discuss
um that professional development goal setting process with Sak so our parent
group has had an opportunity to see and ask questions and give feedback um we also shared with Sak at that time the
number of individuals that we are responsible for providing and I don't have the number but I know Nancy and
Shaye were there and it was large like when you consider both certified and classified it's a lot um we did re
review then the survey feedback with our teacher quality committee um and thus
presented them with the PD structure uh net uh which is the every Wednesday and talking about how we'd
want those Wednesdays to look now we need to throw in another component which is our aea um support that we have and
what does that look like this year so if you remember 100% of the ed services
money which was kind of both the the professional leaders uh side of Heartland and the media money 100% of
those dollars comes to our district for us to decide how to use so we have been
working it's not finalized but here's the here's kind of our planning guide to think about um how much uh in what ways
will aea support our work so think of it like a menu it's literally what it is we're going in and saying hey we need
assistance with mtssb with special education we're going to purchase some media support we're
going to purchase printing we're gonna we're going to put this menu this is what I want on my plate and then we'll
determine how much that cost is and start to reserve their services that actually is due by this Friday so
that'll be my work this week um then pres we presented to District level administrators uh last
week um with looking at what is where we at with the Planning and Building level
leaders I'm sorry District level and then building level regarding what our calendar could look like and how we
start to piece that together updating the board so really in the next few weeks we will then start to piece
together um our professional development calendar we'll decide when is it a building we've expanded our groups we'll
make sure we're identifying when classified staff um will meet and and just we've added some more details so
this really I think is a pretty good example of continual Improvement in progress so let's um let's stop there
for just a moment what questions might you have about planning for next year or PD that we've done so
far maybe just a question on the classified staff um I think that was the first year we've had that robust of a PD
program I know you said that there was some mixed feedback in there but just maybe a couple of things that you're
thinking about modifying for next year to make that more effective for that crew yes um Carrie please feel free to
to speak up here as we go along uh number one we need to have their voices at the table so if you go back February
of 24 uh Dr Bloom and I and I remember if anybody else met with the the
classified staff over at the high school and a overwhelmingly uh overwhelming response
was we need professional development we need to learn so um from there what we
also didn't want to do is is going to the every Wednesday early out there were concerns about people not being able to
maintain their current level of pay for those those additional two they wanted you know to be receive opportunities for
compensation so from there we identified hey here's two learning opportunities per month and then we assigned content
so we actually had a planning session because it was not La it was never last minute but it was in July we
didn't have their voices at the table we maybe be we put together content that we believed would be fitting and in many
cases people loved it right it's probably a little bit like a third a third a and a third seems like what I
get every time I survey a third are like yeah this wasn't this was a miss a third
said no I liked it there could have been some things that you did better but it was it was okay and a third were like
yes I really needed that opportunity and I I would guess that's pretty close to that uh so we will have their voices at
the table this time so car's going to lead up that and I support however I can with finding out hey what's it look like
and we have several roles within those classified staff so we have special education Associates we have some
general education Associates I might have to look back at my list of of who all those those groups are so a one-
siiz fits-all probably isn't going to matter the second thing um that we're going to try and do is just understand
what it looks like for choice choice is a motivator and so if I can choose the
content rather than being told what I'm going to learn is Choice possible it may or it may not be because we have to find
find a provider um we may have it with internally in our own staff someone who can deliver that but I I think choice is
really important when we can maybe they would choose to take um well what else let me back up then the other piece
outside of choice is the course offerings and I say course meaning a course of study whether that's two weeks
a month so is there a way that we could say hey we're going to do some autism training uh for four weeks and for those
four weeks you're going to come every Wednesday for those four Wednesdays and then you would have four off so is there
just a different way of us delivering it besides at twice a month so it's the
delivery model those to me are the three big changes that I would say we're going to look at differently this time in
hopes of making improvements yeah thanks for that there's a lot of success there for a first year program so thanks for all the
work that you put in and you know I think by and large it went really well so thanks for the work there thank you
and I would say that's not a model I've seen in other places around the Metro so when we talk about Innovative that is
not something I've experienced as a principal where classified staff that I worked with got any sort of training on
a regular basis so we appreciate that um I'm gonna move oh I'm sorry any other questions from the group
about GRE can I just add real quick K and Greg have been awesome and just as a reminder this is
for our bus drivers are getting this training custodians are getting this training so this is our all of our
classified staff as getting what we think is pretty decent specific to the job but then also to our strong
instructional framework like they're all getting that piece as well so hopefully they feel tied to just teacher's getting
that bus driver getting that Greg's getting that depending on your job you're you're getting hopefully some
attention you deserve so I won't expect you to read this Nick can you read the third one down I'm sorry okay no but
this is what I do want to show you is We have basically certified class of if IED
and then other there are 15 groups alone and what you could probably see is just
in this group this is administrators this is teacher leadership I mean Within These there's multiple Realms of groups
so I would venture to say that's nearly a hundred groups that we're responsible for and try to plan it just it's like
putting together a very large thousand piece puzzle without the picture sounds ruting I like analogies
okay moving on um Iowa Statewide assessment of student progress um updates we're in the thick of uh la like
we're doing great our principles uh every week an email goes out at 800 am
on Monday morning with here are your to-dos I want to give a shout out to the principals our special ed um teachers
our counselors and our El teachers because they have been getting names for accommodations they have done it
flawlessly then we've locked it and cleaned it up the forms um everything is on track we're well ahead um and I think
part of it is just my proficiency of having done it now once before but um we will begin testing March 31st Monday
March 31st and it will run through Friday April 25th there's four weeks every building has a different schedule
of sorts um but this just provides you with an information that we are um complying with all the requirements of
test security um test Administration safety but this takes a very large team
and they have been doing amazing so so thank you to that Sak um we had our
meeting for Sak on February 3rd you can see the agenda there I love this team I
don't know why I get so excited about meeting with them um I think it allows a chance for our building principles to
share about what's happening down at the building level um Nancy and Shaye I know and Nick um I'm not sure if Nick you
were there but if if uh you guys have been participants and so I don't know if you have anything you want to add from
that meeting but we really focused on where we at it was really that very same update that we provided um to the board
about our midyear goal updates and then also uh information on bullying and
harassment questions about those two things okay lastly mtss um B goal work
so I want to give you an update here um as you recall one of our school Improvement goals is mtss in the area of
behavior and we had those two we had a long range and a short range or short-term one-year goal and that
focused this year on completing a study of best practices and mtss support um
and it was written for both academics and behavior we have really just focused on Behavior because we have a lot of
needs in that area but our a our academic work continues to get uh better
so what you can see is um I want to take time to acknowledge that our philosophy here with mtssb and the approach is uh
as you see from Emily Donovan's report our buildings are all in different places by Design and that is okay we
want to stop and celebrate that this is not a race or a contest there's not any
no prizes given out here um but what we do want to do is examine uh have buildings examine their practices
against best practice and decide what action steps they want to take what we
don't want to do as a district is come down and say hey we are we know that at your building you've done all this hard
work and now we're going to change it by telling you what you have to do we know that would not be successful and that
would not honor what people have been doing so we decided to do a more systems level approach where we are going to
define mtss multi systems to support for Behavior at the district level we'll be
talking about what do we believe about students what do we believe about behavior and discipline um what do we
what do we believe about consistent rules how do we think about creating structures in our schools for kids to
learn predictability and um what's you know how how to um be successful in the
classroom and in the in their buildings and then we will ask buildings to reflect at the building level what do
they need to do so while we're at the very beginning some buildings might be hey we've already got this we're good to
go but they're going to help us shape our district understanding so what I provided to you and Nancy I think you
asked about this last time was was Emily's report she did an excellent job I feel like um what's makes this report
so wonderful is that she's gone down to the buildings so she met with principls and coaches anybody else that wanted to
talk with her met with District people um I feel like she she captured the heart exactly of what work we need to do
and what we know are the challenges um this so we did just start with our district learning on uh well
gosh it was February 11th so once a month for about two hours we're going to
do this District work this will continue into next year whether or not our goal is still the same uh and I I can't speak
for principles and and whoever else was in that meaning they each building was able to bring uh maybe as many people as
they wanted but they could bring some staff to learn along with them and I just I felt like our first meeting was a
a strong opportunity for us to learn together around this topic so um with
that I'll ask you know what questions do you have I can certainly answer what this might look like going forward or or
anything you have based on what you read um obviously our buildings are unique
and that was referenced by Mrs Miss Donovan and her um report different
buildings have embraced the traditional PBIS structure um others use zones of
Regulation um one of the things that she highlighted though was kind of a lack of a
systemic language um when educating our kids and
these kids then all filter up to the middle school and we see that we have
increased behaviors including physical aggression in particular Oak View and
then at the high school so I'm just kind of curious as
to our plan moving forward and how we can
because now that we have this data we have a moral impetus to do better yeah
that's well said so um the way we would look at this is systems work is really hard work um you
know U individual leaders that they're building have a responsibility to lead their building and and each one is so
unique that we couldn't apply a general rule but we do see the value of the consistent rules from place to place
that doesn't take away I used to say every building has a flavor you can sometimes tell the flavor when you walk
into a building um we don't want to take that away what we do want to do is coach
so we have decided we have a a rubric or a matrix and I didn't put that Matrix in there and I and I can always share that
with you at sometime it's nothing it just says Hey like at level at tier one
here are the characteristics of a really successful tier one we're asking those building leaders to look at that with
their leadership teams and maybe they don't even have a leadership team started yet so we're even back at the philosophy stage then they're going to
say yeah we have evidence that we're doing this work we're really proud of it they could share with other buildings
hey what are you doing at your place what's happening here um then if a if a building says we haven't even gotten a
leadership team started yet instead of being stuck or Frozen with I don't know
what to do I'm not sure how to have this happen what needs to happen is there on this Matrix but then we will be able to
coach whether that's Emily because we still have time left with her on the contract whether that's an administrator
at our building level or at the district level whether that's principal to principal what we know is coaching and
reflection feedback for those leadership teams is going to move the needle faster
so what we're doing is if right now this is the variation and that's okay variation is okay we're trying to reduce
that variation by having common rules and that should support teachers like I
think as Emily would point out it's actually helpful when the teacher might say hey it's a really tough job really tough classrooms having common language
and common expectations and the ability to talk with each other about how do we address behavior when we see it actually
helps not only does it should it reduce the behaviors but it also enables and empowers teachers to feel confident in
addressing it it's a big study I mean we're we're going to be at this another
year or more um but we also don't want to ex we don't want to have people sitting there going oh we've already
heard this we've been through this before so we're going to work to get off with like what are those common
expectations for buildings then we'll move into tier one tier two and tier three and let the buildings um start
their work so it's a little bit of a of a coaching we want here's best practice
and here's what we want to Define best practice and then Empower you because we want to empower them to go and and work
towards best practice and Nancy what I'll add which I think is so cool is what Greg's kind of mentioning and
referencing is we're doing that with our principles and some of their Folks at the district level so like this Matrix
we're getting on the same page what's our common language what's our expectation so we can do this together
with the admin crew and their people and then they can take that kind of modeling and so okay now it's time that we go
into our buildings which are probably at a little different stages and do the same kind of modeling we did with the
district team but now we get to do it ourselves so it's not here's the report here's some things we got to get better
at go no districtwide what do we believe in and now let's take that and apply it
to buildings kind of depending on where at so it's a neat little kind of step step by step we're going to do
together obviously that vertical articulation piece is going to be
incredibly important and the more we do it we will see a change in our data um
one of the things that she highlighted specifically is discipline and so I'm
just kind of curious about um how are we going down the path of restorative
practices um when dealing with discipline because we do have certain hot spots where we have physical
aggressions um and how are we
using best practices and discipline to mitigate those situations so that would
appear could appear at all three tier levels correct right so this idea of
conse consequences alone never changed Behavior so what we know is we've kind
of lived this experience where consequence and and you have to have consequences behaviors have consequences
but if we don't do proactive teaching it's never going to change same as you know when a student doesn't know their
alphabet what in kindergarten what do we do we teach them the alphabet we don't make them go sit in a corner or get time
out we teach them the alphabet what do we do when a student doesn't know proper behavior expectations or isn't Meeting
those Behavior we have to teach behaviors fortunately right now we spend a lot of time in conse consequences and
that has a place but it also can uh come at the cost of relationships kind of
what you said is relationships with adults and relationships with peers if I
my behavior is so aggressive that I'm causing disruptions in the classroom and yet I'm unaware of how my behavior
affects all of your learning That's not healthy that as I think her one point
that often gets overlooked is this is about essential employability skills too how are we going to support kids as they
leave and get into the the Work World outside of school or or university settings and things like that so I mean
to that extent uh those practices of restorative conversations U maybe it's a classroom
method of Champs where we we are up close or um very descriptive with kids
about here's what it looks like when we use social um social thinking language like um you know how does your talk with
kids about how their behavior impacts others any of those models that's where we said we're not sure that there may be
at tier one a set curriculum that we need to look into but at tier two and tier three it's some of those additional
practices check in check out um restorative practices all of those have a have a place um in coming up I mean I
think we're not there yet because we're still at the very much the what do we believe about students and their
behavior do we think they're doing it to us you know if that's what we believe then we're always going to come with a
con consequence for them if uh if we say hey they're not giving us a hard time
they're having a hard time some of those understandings about the functions of behavior help us to think differently so
we can have a restorative conversation rather than just a punitive one so it's
coming um when well I would say we're probably I I would say we could get
there by summer as I think teams have an interest in that because they're at different places a team that doesn't
even have a leadership team around behavior isn't going to be ready for restorative practices one one model that
I think I have seen work really well and youve probably experienced this Nancy and Johnson is where we have buildings
who have what I call promising practices this has worked really well for us and she um cites that in here as we have
some buildings who have really well established processes those can be models for us to look at and I think
then a building's going to have to say hey I'm hearing about restorative practices tell me more so we may not get
everybody there at the same time they may be going in different
spots any other questions with that okay well thanks for your time and
yeah sounds good thanks Greg Dr Bloom all right all right thanks Greg
again thanks Ryan we'll just kind of go through my stuff here uh new permits we had six in January six uh in Grimes and
in zero in Dallas Center right now but we're at six but we'll keep that number at the bottom or 142% let's just keep
more houses coming no matter where we can get them so six for this year
Staffing just a quick update we had our four we shared the four retirees and as
of Friday we we have nine resignations of teachers going um moving going to
different places um all their all their fun next step so we're at nine we in the
next couple of weeks here as a senior leadership team will really start to narrow down you know the moving and
shaking of people internally when we know we've got jobs open we start internally who wants to maybe switch to
a different grade level switch to a building so we'll do that following that we'll start getting our uh post postings
out for positions that we're we're looking at hopefully that coincides well with when legislator wants to do their
thing with the SSA we'll be meeting in the next couple of weeks with Tom Clark and his team uh DC GAA to kind of talk
negotiations so I think we're on a good just at least timeline of of where things are at so
we'll start to you'll you'll see some postings starting to come in the next few weeks after we kind of do the internal thing and then the external
thing so all right what we got enrollment so you
you kind of looked at the chart I'll do quick on this one um we are down three
resident students by math this month 14 um have moved and you see the breakdown
three they've moved to the metro schools one outside of the Metro four out of state three went to online out of the
country and two to homeschool and we had 11 students that moved into dcg over the
past P month so there's your minus three um overall with the breakdown of where
folks are going and where they're coming from next on my list let's talk
registration please and Mr Ellingson I'm hopeful you could help me out if I can put you on the spot can you share those
documents with the screen for our guest to to be able to see we're going to start gang on the
2526 enrollment numbers so maybe the second dock on there sorry AO I'm
putting you on the spot don't do it yeah that's a
surprise oh wait March 4th we should all vote for our P thanks
AJ all right anything else you want to share with I'll
of I'm just glad the hawys aren't playing otherwise AJ would have accidentally put that game on there I'm sure oh second one there AJ J on the
thank you appreciate it okay so here's what registration looks like for the 25
26 school year as of Friday and let's start with the left
side what we've done tons of credit to Dean and deetta for all their hard work every day new stuff comes in which is
exciting but as of Friday the numbers on the left are simply rolling everybody over if you
were in third grade we are assuming you're coming to fourth grade right in each building so it's
just rolling people over it's obviously moving our seniors on their next life and it's the registrations that have
come in already so if you have registered for kindergarten if you know you're moving from out of state and
coming to dcg and you registered those are all the numbers history tells you a
lot of new families including kindergarten tend to uh register more in summertime
so the numbers I'm showing you were probably not jumping up and down about
right now but I hope that's the worst case scenario right that more are just
going to come but we are three weeks in to registration again I just want you to know those numbers are rolled over plus
existing registrations today so we'll just look at the elementary team as a whole so again again this is just kind
of the surprising thing dcg is not immune to this it's just kind of around elementaries all over are kind of
down so as a whole we're down 104 elementary students that is
including some of our um prek crew our our preschool numbers are down again
hopefully those come back up um but collectively you see kind of down 22
students at dce down 13 at Heritage 47 at Northridge and 22 at South Perry so
again those are folks after you roll over the S the fifth graders on and people that we just must have right now
lower preschool and kindergarten numbers I keep being optimistic that they'll
keep coming every single day and that number just keeps going down and down but here's the interesting spot we're in
right we're down as a district but we're up in some places the middle school is
going to be up is up right now at about 11: Fus down 13 and we are seeing the
increase of 30 already at the high school we know that's kind of a a
building that we're keeping attention on they are um one added teacher to the
high school officially ends every person having a classroom so we start sharing
next year um because that group and I'm going to get the number wrong but that
30 is going to put us you know closer to that 1100 Mark and
1200 is the max or so on that that Max is is not where we need to
be so that's why we're talking you know kind of bonding stuff for lots of reasons but so down in the district
right now up in a couple of places on the right won't read to all of you that
is the breakdown by grade by building so you can just see where the numbers
currently are um as of Friday and it's also open spots so are preschool open
spots right now we have three open androll requests for transitional
kindergarten yay 20 open enrolled requests for um kindergarten yay so
we're can to add those numbers in once we can officially give those families the thumbs up
so um please please keep registering keep sending families questions to me Indiana so we can help them if they've
got any questions but I'll uh try to kind of make this a continual thing to update you on how registration is going
so any questions on this doc first and I can answer for the
team okay AJ if you don't mind buddy can we do the other on so I've had some great questions about you know and a lot
of it is good open dialogue because of our conversations about dce but Bloom where where are all of our kids at time
like let's talk about you know when sections get capped and we got to send kids to another part of dcg like what do
that what does that look like so I appreciate those questions very much so I thought let's put it on paper for
everybody and an awesome job again Deanna gets all the credit for this um I hope I do her a hard work justice but
I'll you know just maybe two quick things of note if you look at the 2425 school year so the one we're in we only
have six kids now maybe I shouldn't say only but we do have six kids and one of
those students is at um a neighborhood of Dallas Center lives in Dallas Center that we send to Northridge as you know
we're we're capped at kindergarten and actually above that a little bit um that
student moved in December to Dallas Center so they are now at Northridge we have five students at Heritage three of
them go to Northridge two go to South Prairie and let me all preempt this um document with this gang this is only the
section is full in that neighborhood building by a grade so they go somewhere else and I'll tell you why that's
important in a second but these are all kind of apples to apples the section is full so they've got to go somewhere okay
so six total one dce five at Heritage you've got some time now to to
look at this other Dock and and folks in the audience or folks listen if anyone wants this it's all yours just shoot me
a note but over the the other part we did here is we kind of said over the last five
years what have we done in in terms of section um you know when and section
enrollment is capped where did they go I think if I can be honest I think there's
a little bit of maybe a misnomer that it's just kind of a Dallas Center thing it certainly has been at times but it's
it truly is all of our elementary buildings and I just added it up more out of curiosity because you can see
they're kind of colorcoded so you can kind of follow each building by year but
if I attempted to do math right over the last five years we have sent four dce
students outside of their neighborhood school to another Grime school we sent 31 students from Heritage to different
schools 21 students at Northridge and one student at South Prairie
so we we've kind of done it to everybody um but at least again I appreciated the
awesome question about where do all of these kids go and where are they from so
questions maybe on this doc the process that I can help with but good to just
put some numbers next to some questions so we're all working with the same facts I appreciate seeing this this is really
really great to see um where things are going um I guess it's worth noting that
the one section at dce in kindergarten started in 23 right or 22 are we have
three years into this we're in year two okay so this so that illustrates why those kids then absolutely were moved
out yep um we and then seeing it in other buildings too is is enlightening
yeah so again great great questions and food for thought
there okay so thanks for giving me a little registration time keep those folks coming and quickly strategic
planning so we are hot and heavy in it with Teamworks met with the strategic planning team about two weeks ago now uh
the admin team tomorrow morning has Julie for 90 minutes over Zoom to kind of talk about really we're getting into
the action card so we are now really narrowing down that operational plan of what is going to be on kind of that
three-year Vision what are some of those five I think it's going to turn out to be about five big rocks that we want to
tackle and then how are we going to start to tackle them so you'll have Julie with the admin team tomorrow
and then you're going to hang out with her get some quality time with Julie um in March April and May so you have the
March date here in a couple weeks on the 10th um and then I'll be in touch right with the other dates but we're we're now
starting to get into the nitty-gritty of details and how do we turn all this awesome feedback into tangible steps
moving forward so excited about that and then uh big thanks to the the district
facility team who met last week um OPN and DCI have been working together
around our district for the last kind of four to six weeks they went to every single building they did a physical
assessment as well met with each principal an educational assessment so last Thursday they shared out their
findings hey probably need to start thinking about attention here this looks pretty good here educationally here's
what we're seeing so that group was awesome to meet with they will meet
again in a month or so and that's going to help us prioritize our facility plan
what needs the attention when if I can put a plug for the P vote on the fourth
as a reminder to all of our awesome families the bond is over here we're going to ask for a bond vote here to do
some really really cool things districtwide that's awesome if we don't
have this pble over here all of the stuff that pble takes care of which is that neat video that AJ put together
with um our fifth graders there South mid and in heightland about what does pble do it's your laptops it's your
iPads it's the roof over your head it's the buses it's the furniture it's the carpet that's a whole different Bucket
over here that's not bomb stuff so if we don't have this it comes from general
fund and the last thing we're going to want to talk about is Staffing versus
buses Staffing versus roofs the world allows us to separate
them thankfully March 4th we need our voters to Simply say yes to separating them they're not impacted I don't
believe in any negative way by doing that um but plug for that and plug for our district facility team who's um
volunteering some time to to help us out and then do some cheerleading for us and if anyone wants to be added to that team
public board you shoot me a note you're in I'll get you updated okay um okay
last thing I want to just share a couple of my highlights and thank you to people on The dce Forum we got some awesome
families here that were in attendance as well and then let you all kind of share your insights those were there um first
and foremost the thank yous I bet I don't know 7500 people is a great crowd
in the Commons there it was so neat to see our families kids were there we had a bunch of teachers there admin District
admin um was there so awesome to see the crowd and huge thank you to Greg to AJ
Michelle Deanna I mean I think we got shoot six to eight pages worth of
questions is ahead of time and we did our best to try to answer as much as we can but hours and hours of their time
prepping to make sure everyone's got the right information hopefully the presentation was okay you had to deal with me not
being under the weather a little bit but I just enjoyed the people the questions the camaraderie but thankful for the
staff that um spent the time putting that together and as I shared on the
Forum and then I'll be quiet and let you guys talk the goal was not to convince
anyone in everything hear me from my seat we all agree two sections is the best that that's not a controversy
that's not no one's got to convince anybody of that our goal was information
to be blunt there's too much in correct information out there it's just there's too much so our goal was to try to share
some facts to try to share information me I appreciate your comment like maybe this little sheet just helps with some
of the questions right so we can send that presentation to anybody um again we
just want the right pieces of information out there because we we just you know we get enough questions we get
enough hey this screenshot of this message and like please just call us we'll shoot you straight I've had a
blast meeting with families um oneon-one got to do that today again and just kind
of talk their experience share a little insight into how we do things um so
again I hope it was more beneficial than not but would love to those that were able to be in attendance would love to
hear your feedback on the night as well so I do have a question um in regards to
some of the information that's being shared and um I don't know that we've touched on this though but um what's the
retention rate at Dall Center Elementary so I look at retention rate
maybe just like who has left and I'm just going to my two years here we have had um last year we had a
retiree okay uh B jarner who we love love dearly retired was Kindergarten
we've had a staff member um leave to teach with her uh child in another in
another District now I will say I had a great conversation with that staff member to be fair I think they
were a little worried about where things were going so I think that was part of maybe moved to another district with
their child but they're in the same district with their child and then we've had a we had a teacher move with their fiance to St Louis um those were all
last year and then right now we have one teacher that will be moving uh with her
husband and young family a couple hours away so if I'm missing somebody Greg Carrie jump in but my two years here
were four teachers have left dce one has somewhat shared I think
talking about the two section the others are retirees and moving but four okay
yeah thank you and if you guys want any history on other buildings or something I'd be happy to provide that and I did
actually share let me just get these notes Monica I'll find it retention last year because that was a great question
we had six talking uh certified staff only 290
certified teachers last year six retired and 17 resigned that means 92% of our
staff teaching staff returned um as of the Forum four retirees five
resignations that was a return rate of 97% I told you we're up to nine so
whatever my math maybe drop it a percent or so so right now we're probably in the 90 sixish percent so we're in the mid
mid 90s for the two years so far and that's districtwide District W okay yep thank you you bet
so yeah what other those that were able to come what were your thoughts maybe what questions you received or feedback
i' first time doing that so be happy to learn from that as
well I was to say it was really hard to see things so I was in the back I would
have maybe a bigger area next time um and just being able to that so was very difficult to kind of almost hear
sometimes people's questions so it was that would be my only kind of concern about that is some of the people in the
back it was hard to see or hear so yep good co I thought that the turnout was really
um heartening I think to see a vast majority of the community come out in
support of um their school and also to
see um people who don't have kids in school still care about the impact of
having an operational um and fully functional building in the community and
understanding what that means for the community at large um some of the feedback I I've received tons of
feedback it's one of the blessings and curses of my job um is that people know
exactly where to find me several hours a week and I can't leave
um that said I think a lot of the feedback that I received
um fell into two categories one of it was I still have a lot of questions I appreciate that they tried to answer
questions but I still have so many more can we do this again in a different format and then the other uh pot of
feedback is kind of the English teacher version of a so what okay we had this
conversation what are you going to do about it what are we going to do about it what is the actual Next Step um and
so sometimes that's um frustration sometimes that's like let me at it I'm
ready to work a problem um and again it's all sorts of community members and it's Grimes families and it's um people
who don't have kids but they're lawyers or their you know um
Community I don't know like Economic Development kind of people like it's everyone everyone has a vested interest
in trying to work a problem um and again that's just really heartening it's been
really um inspiring to see so many people who kind of care in in a time
where apathy is readily available um I do appreciate everyone taking the
time I mean a lot of people here were there I think that that speaks volumes
um and seeing people that I wouldn't have guessed would have been there were
there right like we had all walks of life we had all socioeconomic
uh than you strata represented um it's
everybody and I think that that's an excellent um um cross-section of the demographic of what makes up Dallas Center Grimes and um the more we talked
about it it's not just the Dallas Center problem and that's becoming abundantly
clear for so many people um so yeah those are some of my key takeaways
thanks for that feedback yeah so I know we received an email um
stating some possible solutions to the problems where where when do we discuss that or when is that like just curious
on what the next steps are for that because it seemed to be very well thought out I was very impressed with
what she sent us um you know she broke down the cost and what it looks like for
you know all being able to keep um most of two classrooms I think so I just was
curious on what the next steps are from that email if that's something that we look at yeah so from my chair a couple
of things one is that's why I'm glad as kind of the Forum and and maybe conversation with the ad hoc committee that comes later is kind of maybe some
help with guiding next steps on a that's probably maybe a little bit more of a bigger picture um now with the with the
document that was shared it was you know met with that parent several times
um good information I will say probably not completely accurate okay um working
with Michelle specifically on the budget there's just there's some missing components there to say like uh it would
only be a a $20,000 increase that that's just not correct okay um so it's just
working through some of those it's the Staffing conversation I mentioned it's figuring out SSA when it gets set you
know I hope this doesn't sound like kicking down the terms just all the things that go in there um combined with
you know dcg is is losing money right now because of rssa combined with lack
of um enrollment or not lack just a decline in enrollment and the last thing any us are going to do in this room is
not give teachers and Associates and bus drivers every penny we possibly can in
terms of a raise next year so it's having that conversation and then really kind of seeing what truly is fiscally
responsible that's not going to harm us years down the road but where can we
kind of maybe I always say put on the credit card and the hopes that over a couple years the um the kids come back
enrollment wise so that all seems like a lot of it has to happen kind of fast but
there's probably some other factors at play before we start making firm decisions on August I think committee
work potentially big picture longer term vision is is awesome answers to what do
August look like just has a couple more things in the way before we can make decisions period and that's any staffing
in any building in terms of adding least
Y and for those watching can you clarify for the public I know that the senate
had proposed a 2% SSA right which would not cover the cost of inflation correct
um the house has not made a determination but their recommendation
in the legislature was 2.25 correct yep so if there are parents out there
watching this board meeting right now what should they specifically ask their
legislators for thank you Nancy I appreciate it very much and and you're going to talk about Michelle's going to lead you to a conversation about budget
guarantee which unfortunately is kind of a history setting at dcg not one we want
to have 2% or 2.25% SSA so new money the state's going
to give us for every student would still put dcg in budget guarantee what that means is you've lost enough money
meaning from SSA and lack of enrollment or lack of growth that the state's
actually going to come in and kick in some extra money to almost get you back
to zero and Michelle will do a much better job explaining than I am but that's their way of saying look you were
here and now you went to here we're going to try to soften this fall for a year there's
a80 Michelle can you give me not 180 school districts in the state of Iowa
are going to go on budget guarantee at 2% at
2% that should tell us all something as just Public School advoc that over half of the districts are going to have that
much less money because of lack of funding indoor enrollment that they have to step in and help like on top of
everything else so I would ask our constituents it's emailing your legislators picking up the phone I mean
if we got 3% that's still way low that's a entirely different conversation than 2%
3.5 four I mean it's each each full percent two to 2.25
doesn't do much to be honest each full percent becomes a little bit that much more of a game changer so and over the
past three years we've seen a decrease in SSA by our legislators correct
correct y so 3% 2.5 and now the recommended 2.5 yep and I want to I want
to do right by folks when they do right by dcg that they certainly have stepped up in the one-time funding to get
teachers those salary increases that that will come this year or last year and this year and then it stops um so
they've got these onetime things that's they refering out personally for dcg we don't want to live in this onetime game
it's hard to do Staffing in the moment in long term if you're just going to get
potentially a check in the moment it's hard to as you know to think long term with so it it's nice but it's not a
helpful plan the SSA is truly the driver combined with enrollment those are the
two best friends so and do you know what the current state budget surplus is not
off hand but you're going to tell me $6 billion thank you okay so it's not that
the state does not have the funds available to appropriately fund our public schools and I I just don't want
our parents I want so much confidence them they hear from us all the time and I
think they're good people down there right they're service leaders which is awesome but I'm sure if you get an email from another superintendent another
principal you you listen but you kind of just yep when they hear from the people
that are voting them in in different walks of life and that becomes a number they pay attention and so I just hope as
we talk about everything from raises to two sections to getting materials for
our kids and the book and all that stuff that's all general fund stuff that is SSA and so please please Advocate with
your legislator because we are kind of appold it to their figures that they give us so thanks answer for those
questions anything else on this topic I had one just quick item and I um
probably heard it tonight more than I did in the Forum was about a concern that Dallas Center Elementary could
close yep and I just wanted to talk about um you know you hear that you hear
school districts making that decision I think Newton recently announced that they were closing a school um but I I
would just want to we had a good opportunity to meet with both Dallas Center and Grimes leadership in the last
week and a half two weeks and I you know what we heard from Grimes is look there's there's 7,000 individual
addresses in Grimes something like that there's 5,000 more platted I know in
Dallas Center there's 60 um single family home uh blots platted or
something like that plus some multif family development that's uh being discussed or maybe even further along
the discussion so the reality is right now we're seeing a dip in enrollment but
I think it's very temporary I mean if we think about it in the Long View here and maybe that's four or five years
something like that I think we will see houses being built families moving to
the school district I think enrollment will come so so that's just one I think think
it's you know I don't think this is a doomsday scenario I really don't and as far as Dallas Center Elementary goes the
I think the most foolish thing this school district could do would be close that school and here's why if we were to
close that school unless we repurposed it which there' be no net gain to the school district for
doing um we have to put that school up for public auction it goes away and then
when that enrollment comes back then we have to go build another school to service those kids or forever pay to
bust them somewhere else neither of which makes any sense to me so I I don't
know that that's widely known about the the rule that you have to go to public auction if you abandon a school um but
you know we're not I think in the situation that some of these other school districts are where they're having to close schools I I just don't
think we're there and I don't I think we've got a Glide path that takes us to a different place that's going to get us
to um you know schools that are that are more full than they are today
to play Devil's Advocate to that point though at a certain point with a dip in enrollment it becomes untenable or at
least irresponsible to financially keep a building occupied if there are not enough students in
it so typically speaking if a building falls below like 150 students which DC
is projected to do this year it becomes more expensive to keep it open than it
does to scooch those kids somewhere else that may be true Meg in a in a very
short window of time but I don't think if you look at it over a longer time Horizon if you look at it at the district level but if we're talking
about declining enrollment and not having enough money and getting a credit card and money is getting really tight I it's it's not outside of the realm of
possibility or completely irrational for people to have these concerns we can
give them a a a verbal guarantee today that we don't have a plan to close it
but again at a certain point it becomes financially irresponsible unless you are going to equitably distribute some kids
and some funds you're going to have for a lack of a better term and I really hope this isn't like a term that gets
People canceled but like a red-headed stepchild of the district and it's also one of your high highest rank buildings
so sure it would be longterm not a good idea but in the short term when we are
pinching every penny to make sure that we have non-leaking ruls it does stand
to reason that it wouldn't be outside of the realm of possibility to refunction
that building into something that doesn't have kids I I just disagree I don't think
that there's a a set of scenarios now or even in the immediate future that tells us that that's what we
would need to do I sincerely hope that's true I I don't I don't think that there
there's any question that people think that Dallas Center is not going to grow that grime's not going to grow it's just
it's you know it's one of those times where you got to manage enrollment where it's at you got to manage open
enrollment and and be um as accommodating as you can that's a different role than what this district
has has had to play even time I've not been on the board six years and in that
time I remember a time we were plus 150 in terms of open and roll in compared to open and roll out I think we're plus 30
30-ish now it's just a different time and so in in a different time you have
to use different measures but I think those are adjustments uh deciding to put a school
up for public action is more than just an adjustment that's a that's a huge shift and that's making a really
long-term decision we can only bond for money every so many years and um it
would be very shortsighted for the school district to Slough a school and then find our elves within a half a
decade at a place where we don't have enough capacity in our current schools we don't have the bonding capacity to go
um raise enough money to then go build a new school I think people would be really frustrated with us if we did that
so I understand that the Optics can be ominous but I really don't think they're
as ominous as what they may appear to be and um you know we're going to have to go through some lean times here and I
understand that there's decisions that we're going to have to make along the way that may be less than ideal but I don't think in my personal opinion that
selling a school or putting it up for public auction and closing it is anything that we should be talking
about
okay anything else okay um Miss
wouth to's and revenue and expenditure sta summary
report you'll notice that we're at 66.7% through the fiscal year noting
that expenditures are 54.6 5% of the Appropriations at this
time running just a little bit ahead of where we have been in the past um part
of that I attribute to the timing of open enrollment payments uh as far as Revenue uh looking
once again we're at 54.72 per Revenue just slightly behind
once again that's the timing of open enrollment payments I believe moving forward looking at the
public budget comparison report remember this is the report that compares what you've actually spent at this moment in
time compared to what you published in the certified budget uh last March
you'll notice that we are under the 66.67% in every category but I remind
you that in the instruction area the timing of that is a little different than the fiscal school year it actually
begins in September and goes through August and so we're going to monitor that first one that instruction one very
closely to determine if we need to amend in that area before May
31st looking forward um on the agenda to budget guarantee now I must confess I
have been um working in school business and school Finance since the stage Cod
dropped me off at Dallas Center Grimes um and this is the first time that I've experienced budget guarantee
so um I I won't call it learning curve but I will um say it's a new
uncomfortable reality that I'm working through on the budget this year I just wanted to point out to you uh how it's
calculated and the very small difference uh that SSA 2% versus 2.25 % actually
makes to the district um you'll notice that uh on line 4.1 of the model I've
given you uh the cost per pupil from 7826 in current year Rises to $
7983 that's $157 increase or 2% that's the governor's uh
recommendation this year and then you'll see on line 4.2 is our budget enrollment
you'll see it's fallen from 351.5 to 344 6.3 or a decline of 55.2
students over the previous year then you multiply the two of those to come up
with the concept of regular program District cost and as you look at regular program District cost online
4.3 for the proposed 26 budget it's
27,5 th000 compared to previous year of
27,42 the important fact here is that's not a 1%
increase uh over the previous year and so what the state does for declining
enrollment school school districts is they cushion the fall they give you funds to match up to that one% Mark so
that it's a slower decline allowing school districts time to plan for the future for either an enrollment blip as
what I'm hoping we're seeing or um planning for the future for what that looks like for Staffing you'll notice
that 2% the state kicks in that
164,384 it actually falls to uh about 999,000
instead of 164 but really does not give us very much more dollars because we're
still shooting for that 1% Mark for us it's a little over 2.6 for us to even
break ground out of budget guarantee guarantee um amounts budget guarantee requires a
resolution by the board stating that you choose to participate and so that will be in new business tonight we'll send
that on to the Department of management so that they are aware that we would like this to be folded into our budget
and it is very important for us to take a look at that resolution and realize
how important it is to us functioning in the next year do you have questions about budget
guarantee so now I'm going to back up a minute I'm going to talk about certified budget timeline you'll also notice
tonight that I've given you a new proposed timeline for certified um budget timeline because I also need you
to approve the publication of the proposed budget tonight so that I can present the budget to you on next Monday
night so the new two uh hearing process
kind of messed with us just a little bit and I had the next board meeting during
spring break so we have uh revamped that and given you new timeline I'm going to
ask you to approve the publishing of the certified budget uh tonight and then
visit with me in a work session um to learn even more about the budget next
week finally um I just want to remind the board members the patrons present
and all of our community that on March 4th our board has called an election to
consider the renewal of our voted physical plant and Equipment Levy often
referred to as p and all also the renewal of the revenue purpose statement for local option sales tax the two of
those things fund many projects in the district that I know AJ has done a phenomenal job explaining to the
community uh with the help of two talented young students what we spend those dollars on and things that I would
ask you to consider tonight as you look down your listing of bills those two buses that would be P dollars the roof
over your head those are P dollars the improvements that we've made at the high
school most recently those are saved dollars and without the renewal of those things we would have to investigate new
ways to fund those projects so once again March 4th 2025 is uh the election
to consider the renewal of voted p and the revenue purpose statement renewal for secure Advanced Vision for education
or the local option sales tax do you have any questions about that Mrs wman is this one of those
elections where you can request a ballot or do you actually need to go into your local polling place and vote in
person that's a question I don't know the answer to Miss Baker I believe that you actually have
to vote in person and that there will be no absentee ballot requests and so I
think making sure that our stakeholder Community understands how important it is that we actually turn out at this
election um and to take your neighbors with you with that said if there are any
other questions about how we've used pepal how we've used local option sales tax please don't hesitate to reach out
and visit with me I'm happy um to help you understand how we've utilized that
in the district this would be the third renewal of voted pble within the school district and Mak it's renewed for 10
years at a time
any other questions well I'm going to do something I've never done before but I'm going to
ask that we take about a two-minute break before we go into Old business I we've gone for two hours and and we'll
make it as quick as we
can
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e e
all right thank you all um those of you here with us tonight thank you and then
online appreciate it but uh we've still got a quorum of the board so we're going to move along to uh old business so
we've got the second reading of um some
one four five and 700 series policies looking for a motion move to
approve Dickinson second Baker Curtis any
discussion all those in favor indicate by saying I I oppose same sign motion
carries uh we'll move along Ong to new business item a uh the first uh reading
of listed policies just a couple of things to note here um the uh
60314 weeding of instructional and Library materials was moved to
resend um earlier to to um tonight when we approved the
agenda uh but uh this would be uh first reading of four five six and 700 uh
series policies looking for a motion
MCN second Dickinson uh any
discussion I do have I I have one and I'm gon to ask the board to actually let this this motion fall um if you look at
um 7006 um let me be careful here sorry yeah transposed reduction in
employee P pay or student health services student health services okay so the student health services is a new
policy and so um Dr Ken and I talked a little bit earlier today and we we poked
around and we couldn't and we didn't was an exhaustive search but we couldn't find a reference point where other
school districts have this policy we don't have it today and it does appear
as though it could open the district up to some additional services that we don't provide today and so that's kind
of starts to fall into that unfunded mandate bucket so um if we have to have it we have to have it we'll figure it
out I suppose but I think we should pause as a board and maybe ask that we send this back for legal review maybe
get some additional information from iasb um on on that particular policy can
I ask how this policy came to be yeah so um
iasb has given um this guidance on mandatory and annual review so this is
one the 6072 the regulation would fall under what iasb says is
mandatory so we're good rule followers right we like to follow rules so when we read it it might also be in the eye of
the beholder the policy 67.0 2 we have that and have had that
and it was revised last year sometime I think so in that it calls and says that
the superintendent will develop regulations thus why R1 is there um but
as I did as he mentioned is I've done a kind of a search around uh not everybody
has this policy so are there other ways in which we could implement the regulation without this and to to Ryan's
point exactly what does this mean for us what does this open up to um let's do
some more homework on it before we would we would move on which I fully support and that's how the process should work
so so that's how it came to be is because we see it as mandatory um we just need some clarification awesome
thank you good thanks any other discussion on policies all right I'm going to move us
ahead to vote and so um I think we would want to let this uh particular motion
fall and then when we raise a new motion I think it would be we need to approve as
amended uh since we moved the one polic to resend and then we're going to
table um 6072 R1 okay all those in favor indicate by
saying I oppose same sign I motion Falls

2.6 2.6 2.6 okay all
right any other discussion ask for 3% yeah everybody R your legislation ask
for 3% please all those in favor indicate by
saying I I poose same sign motion carries um item M consider the creation
of an ad hoc committee identifying programs and resources that will both attract and retain teachers and students
to Dallas Center Elementary uh this was a request that uh director Dickinson
raised um director Dickinson could you provide some additional information sure thing um so like I said after the Forum
on the 4th there were a lot of a lot of lot of people who reached out both in person via email on my phone literally
everywhere the um so what are we going to do now and how do we actually work this issue um not just as a Dallas
Center Elementary issue but as a districtwide issue like I said before um however it looks right now like a Dallas
Center Elementary issue but um given that we have 20 open and roll requests
for kindergarten it's not that there's a shortage of kindergarten bodies it's just that there are shortage of kindergarten bodies in Dallas County um
or at least in Dallas Center um so one of the things or one of the things that
kept getting brought up over and over is how can we collectively work together to
collaborate and and talk about things do the research and then present to the district so it's
not just a one-way version of communication it's not just this desperate um selection of stories it's
it's cohesive it's um Collective and also researched and um and in tandem
with the district right parents want to work with the district to help solve problems enrollment is going to be down
in almost every single building so what can we do to work together to help
ease that for other for for everyone right if we're doing it for all of our
students then we need to be doing it for all of our students um and so one of the
things that in speaking to several parents um that became abundantly clear is that a committee is kind of a good
way to do that and given that that is a a responsibility that um directors can
take on um I thought I'd pitch it at the table and see what happens so so as you can see um this particular ad hoc
committee would look into resource allocation review um assess current
issues but then also what are other creative things that we can do to work a problem um going forward if this is a
short-term issue in the short term what can we do best for all of our students
um and what can we do best for all of our staff like Bloom has said two sections is obviously best we don't want
our students in overcrowded classrooms that doesn't serve anyone we don't want our teachers teaching in isolation that
does not serve them best what can we do to alleviate some of these things in the short term um and it doesn't necessarily
have to be another teacher it doesn't necessarily have to be busing students from one section to the other I don't know I'm not the smartest person in the
room but collectively we can all be the smartest person in the room um and there
is a lot of research in a lot of other districts that are currently facing the
same financial shortfalls and enrollment issues that we are facing um that have
found ways to work together and make sure that everyone is doing the best for
everyone um as you can see um it's also working with um our strategic planning
item of community and parent involvement that was something that was massive that we talked about when we had our
strategic planning here I remember standing over there and having I don't I don't remember who exactly was on my
team but we were talking about here are all the ways that we can get our parents involved and they can feel like part of the team and that it's not just um well
I got an email from this person and then I got an email from this person and I'm still standing out here on my Island all by myself um what can we do to bring
these people together to the table and have a seat at a table where they can work together to have some findings and
then bring them to the to our table and then we can discuss the issues if these people want to work a problem let's let
them work problem and I don't see any harm in doing so um the committee composition
would obviously require like a a chair um Mrs kale has
been open to serving as that person on this committee um however if we want to
talk about someone else doing that um the composition doesn't necessarily as far as I understand it and I could be
wrong about this have any mandatory makeup um rules so we can cap the number
of people that are on it we can say it has to be two people from Grimes two people from Dallas Center a board member
an admin member like we can kind of go on whatever we feel is best about this
um and also how can we ensure that the
purpose of this committee is something that works for the entire District but
also as part of working for the entire District it is serving Dallas Center Elementary does that make sense okay
cool that was really long and that was a lot thanks Meg um there is a sample uh
motion um Meg did you want to stay with the sample motion or you are you going to raise a different
motion for this um I feel like it looks
good so consider a resolution creating an ad hoc committee identifying programs and resources that will both attract and
retain teachers and students to Dallas Center Elementary I feel like that
wording Works looking for a
motion second Baker Curtis any
discussion maybe maybe have a couple questions so
um obviously I have you I'm assuming done a research on and stuff and so when we talk about an ad hoc committee since
this is something at least when I'm here we haven't done um I guess when we think about an ad hoc
Committee in the formation of that is there something so if the parents want to get involved if the business people
want to get involved um when I looked it up and again I'm sure everybody here knows way more than I do um but it said
that it's advisory nature um and has no responsibility other than what we state that it has and then upon a final
recommendation we'll dissolve okay mhm so is there anything preventing from the
community getting together without us saying they have to have a
committee no but there is a lot to be said for Optics
and also teeth sure a group of community members and parents and whatever can sit
together and come up with all of the plans and all of the world and they can
have five minutes to present to us and we will sit here and not answer any questions and then at the end of
that so what it's not an there's no power unless we approve a committee they're only allowed five minutes is
that what I'm hearing in so far as I understand it unless they figure out a way to get themselves on the agenda and
then at what point do we actually take them seriously okay the second question I had um for this was and again maybe
other people can help me out but the other thing is I want in terms of Optics we need to be really careful and I
looked up like the ISA iasb guidelines we need to represent the entire District
so when you talk about the representation on the committee that you're open to that I think one thing we
need to be careful of is that right now it is serving dce and this is coming from somebody that graduated from this
school don't know anybody else that has lived here my entire life and I live in DC so um I want to look at it from both
places um and I think one thing that you know I didn't know if I should bring it up here or before one thing that really
isn't addressed and I think um city council person brought it up is really this this issue is there's no there's no
housing right so people aren't coming in so I did a little research just to so bear with me but when you look at the
population growth so I was like Hey when was it equal between the two this is going to be Michelle is probably going to correct me on stuff because she was
here on the wagon or whatever it got dropped off but if you go back I was like when was the last time we were
somewhat equal in terms of District in terms of population this is going to exclude Rural and unincorporated areas
but 1986 to 1990 is roughly when the Two Towns were equal in terms of City Limits
so I think one misconception that I heard and I talk to people about um is that this is somehow a right now issue
that it hasn't been developing for what I see is here 34 35 years and I think
the hard part so when I think about the comedian makeup um if you go from 1990
um then you go to 2000 you're looking at 7 out of 10 is in Grimes two you know
2.4 at of Dallas Center you fast forward to 2010 you're looking at 84% to 16%
then now you're looking at the last since 2019 89% to roughly 11% um and over those years Grimes is
growing at the last 34 years using the Sensa data the Census Data 431 people
per year while Dallas Center is growing 11 so I would want to be careful as we talk about this if we're serving Dallas
Center that's one thing if we're serving the community as a whole we need to be very careful that the representation
also represents a whole and also I think working with you know the city council and stuff really this is a housing issue
um and it's been a housing issue for what I see as potentially 34 years um
and so we can do some things but I just want us to be careful that this doesn't turn into something that I grew up with
which is like us versus them and I hope that that's not what it is um so I would be interested you know again I I get
what you're saying about the formation but then obviously the makeup would be then extremely important for me to
represent everybody so if you had your percentages delivered or represented the
way that you would want them it would be 90% folks from Grimes and 10% people
from Dallas Center saying that I'm just saying when we look at population data that's what I'm seeing and so when we
talk about Equity across the district I would want to make sure that all elementaries are represented that would
be equality Equity okay well is different regardless I would want to
make sure both sides of this are at the table because I think what I what I
Envision just state in my opinion what I Envision is if it's lopsided just to dce
and I live there um when a recommendation comes here I'm I'm going to as a board member go well I want
input now from everybody in crimes so while we have a recommendation for one school when I look at this as an atlarge
candidate I'm going to say I want a recommendation from everybody so it's kind of kind of full on deaf ears and we're going to be doing a bunch of
effort for me to make the decision I wouldn't make it if we set this up if that's what we think then I would want
to make sure it's everybody at the table to make a districtwide goal and impact that's the absolute goal of the
committee is to make districtwide decisions that are best for the entire District without excluding
dce sometimes when you have Equity it means that you have to help the people that need a little bit more help even if
it's not super duper fair for lack of a better term like I said I would want
people from Grimes on the committee as well and I think Mrs kale and everybody else in attendance that has invested
interest in this would like to see districtwide representation we'd also like to see a little bit of diversity on
this committee it'd be great yeah just for me I would need to
see what kind of the makeup before I could make up my mind so and that would apply to all committees right like we
just had that great facilities meeting how many DC parents were on that
committee I don't believe any dce came to that committee with dson are Elementary families and coun but we
invited them 100% And we would encourage those families to get involved now and
they can reach out directly to you they still can join absolutely how many DC DC families are were represented on the
reconsideration committee none it's okay I was
there it's not like we're excluding DC D Center and any like the emails go out to
parents Square they go out to all families in our district if Dallas or families choose not to join it that's on
them that is not on our Administration not all committees are volunteer based
some committees are appointed they are appointed by people reaching out or that's not entirely
surveys getting sent out saying who would like to join this not entirely
true in regards to this committee that is very clearly states it is to attract
and retain teachers and students to Dallas Center Elementary um our district as a whole as
we stated earlier enrollment is down across the board not just Dall Center also in Grimes enrollment has been
registration has been open for 20 couple yeah 20 some days y um we know that you
know we have families register late families moving in we also keep hearing
that Dallas Center is going to grow and the houses are going to come right now it's a blip it's a blip across the board
we're not the only District experiencing this our building permit show show that there are no building permits even
happening in Dallas Center right now um we have very minimal in Grim
so I to form a committee to attract and retain teachers and students I mean I
think the city needs to attract people to want to move to their town and build some houses I don't think that is a
Dallas interg Grimes School District issue I would disagree I think that all
districts are facing a marketing issue where we are up against Charter School
and vouchers and if all districts are hemorrhaging students Public Schools as
a whole need to be working together to figure out how to gain and retain
students from wherever whether they move in whether they're the parents that are driving half an hour each way to bring
their kids to a school because they've open enrolled because it suits them best there are people you just have to get
them if I change the verbiage on this to say consider creation of an HW committee identifying programs and resources that
will both attract and retain teachers and students to Dallas Center Grimes would that suit everyone
better now it's a marketing committee I have a question so whatever
this is let's say this committee happens and they come up with their ideas that doesn't mean we have to approve those
correct they would bring us them to us so really it's just a I don't know like a think tank box I
mean it's like that's there to think about things that maybe we don't think about that maybe we're not absolutely and it gives kind of a chance to for
other parents and other people to be involved that they can't do that here at the table so I don't personally see that
we're not approving that whatever they decide we're not saying yes or no right now we're just saying hey let's put a
committee together to think about outside of the box ideas that maybe we have not thought about so personally I
don't think that we're I think we're kind of getting outside of what this really is right now it's literally just a
commit it doesn't literally mean that we're approving anything that they are asking to do so it just my two cents
but thank you Shaye that is a very valid
point other
discussion um the Meg I think it's too narrowly defined I think your other
motion talking about it being Dallas Center Grimes as a district and looking at elementary
enrollment I think is um in my mind more effective I think
that it's a a district issue um at the committee or at the Forum rather there's
a lot of different ideas discussed from you
know a year round school or or a variety of other ideas that were discussed that
I I do think is going to I mean that's a district decision there's going to be Grimes parents and Dall Center parents
alike that are going to be interested in that and um we also heard today I'm sorry I'm going to cut you off and I
understand that that's very rude however we did hear today that South Prairie is willing to do a pilot program that's
building specific and yes does impact the district but is building specific we also heard today during um Greg's
reports that there is a willingness to with buildings based on their needs right where we are making District
policies based on building needs and currently this building has needs and
right now we have a group of parents and community members from both communities that make up this wonderful District
that just want to be able to bring ideas to a table sure um yeah you're not wrong
about those um those items you just mentioned but those weren't done through a Committee of parents those were done
through the work that the admin team does with individual buildings and that's not going to stop and to
reiterate one more time we don't have to accept anything that this team comes up
with well that's neither here nor there I think if we're going to ask our
community members to come to work on something we should make sure that it's
well defined um I looked at the the framework which I I really don't understand it's 260 pages
of um something that was really hard for me to evaluate how you apply this
particular problem to that um Meg you said it's really for the district
overall but then you've also said well no it's really for Dallas Center and that there's some really specific needs
that Dallas Center you know has so I two things can be true
though well okay I think if we look at the way that the board resolution is
written and the motion that was raised my comment is it's too narrowly defined
and I would recommend that we look to broaden it if we want to form an ad hoc
committee okay any other
discussion we'll move us along to vote all those in favor indicate by saying I
I I all those in oppose same sign I
motion Falls I will pause and see if we want to
raise another motion I'd like to make a motion then
for the creation of an ad hoc committee to identify programs and resources that will attack and attract and retain
teachers and students to Dallas Center Grimes Community School
District okay looking for a second second Dickinson okay any discussion so on this
one so when we look up the makeup of the committee will we approve that in a separate thing or is this the approval
for we have another vote to approve said committee correct yeah so a couple of things we'd
have to we'd have to form a resolution so the resolution would be to get defined and we could either Hammer that
out here uh or we'd have to create another time where we get together as a
board and figure out what the content of that resolution is and vote on it can we
add that to our meeting on March 3r we have a budget work session and an
uh Mar 10th we have a work Team Works and March 10th we have work Teamworks but when do we have the what do you call
it when they can come and it's like holding court or something oh
um our entire Board needs to come up with this resolution can we table it and bring it back with a resolution for us
to review I mean I would not be comfortable approving a resolution or a new motion with a resolution that we
don't even have the documentation for right now
I I think I think we could do it either way um I think we would have
to pass it such that the board would reconvene to develop the content of the
resolution or you could let it fall and then we could have a separate um session uh focused on on
this now um we'd have to have a regular meeting I believe we I mean we don't um
in a work session for example we don't take on take up new business we typically don't take action so but we
could have a a meeting before or after it a regular meeting or a special meeting I guess it would
be so um so I think Michelle please keep me
out of the deep water here I want to make sure that the advice I'm giving is correct so I think two two paths forward
here one would be we have a motion on the table
that probably would have to fall and then you'd re ra the U motion with the
uh idea that we would reconvene to detail the
resolution or um we could let it fall or table it
and uh take it up in a special session special
meeting or we could work out the resolution during a work session and
then bring it to a regular meeting I guess would be a third path right now I believe we have an
active motion so it's either going to have to fall or pass and then if you want to consider tabling it that's yet
an additional motion m Michelle I don't know your timeline on the third since
I've got the Teamworks on the 10th that's that's 5 to8 if it works for the board be happy to put something before
or after that I just I don't know your timeline on the third so I didn't want to speak to your amount of time you so I
I am happy to talk budget for four or five hours if that's what you'd like but
I can let me rephrase the question I can cram that into 60 minutes yeah okay so the third the third Andor the 10th could
certainly be an option if we need to have work sessions or special meetings just I'd be happy to work with any or
all of you on that time frame so y so we can do it on the third
do you want me to rewrite it or do we want to work on this together well I I think you could
certainly rewrite it and and come and we could use that as a starting point may but I think the board in my opinion
should collaborate around the content of the resolution I think at that point then we could reach hopefully consensus
and then we could bring it and because I think at the end of the day there's folks from the community that are asking
to be involved which I think we need to hear that as a board and we need to create a a form for that to occur I just think it
needs to be in the context of the entire District it needs to be in the context of something that the entire board could
support okay just throwing this out there you could potentially use maybe the third Depending on time as like a
work session type feel on this and depending on where it goes could then vote I could create a
special uh board meeting for at least voting purposes before after the March 10th
so if that's if you need work time we can create that maybe on the third as a group and then vote the next week or if
you want to do your own and have a special um uh
board meeting on the third we could do that we just need to know the what the board's desires obviously for public
purposes and planning purposes yeah I think we couldn't develop something I mean the reality is
we've got to give appropriate notice so it's either we need to come in have it be in the context of a public
meeting develop this um have that be formed in the way of a motion and then
pass it if we did it in a work session we'd need to bring that back more than 24 hours later so we give the public
notice that we're going to take action so
um I'll have it written by the third we can talk about it then okay we'll
spend um an hour um we we'll plan for an hour on
the third as a work session and then we'll bring it back on the 10th or at some other time that we decide more than
24 hours past the 3 uh to finish um taking
action so we have an active motion um based on that direction then that motion
would need to fall and then we'll move on all those in favor indicate by saying
