1:05
All those in favor indicate by saying I.
1:08

1:10
Motion carries. Moving along to item
1:12

1:14
motion.
1:15
Move to approve. Mber.
1:17

1:22
All those in favor indicate by saying I.
1:24
I.
1:25
Oppos. Same sign. Motion carries. Moving
1:28
along to item five, old business.
1:30
Looking for a motion.
1:35
Move to approve. Dickinson.
1:37
Second. Baker Curtis.
1:39
Any discussion?
1:42
All those in favor indicate by saying I.
1:45
I.
1:45
I.
1:45
I.
1:46
Oppos. Same sign. Motion carries. Item
1:50
six, new business. Um, go to item A,
1:53
emergency reading of listed policies.
1:56
Um can you just maybe give us a little
1:58
background on why this is an emergency
2:00
reading?
2:00
Yes. So this is our um electronic uh
2:04
device policy that needs to be in place
2:07
before the start of school. So waiting
2:10
on ISB language and and just making sure
2:12
we were doing everything the right way.
2:14
We've got that. So um we need an
2:17
emergency one so we can approve that
2:19
ahead of you know start of school
2:21
obviously on the 25th. And the green
2:24
that you have seen is is just kind of
2:26
the ads because we need to make sure the
2:27
language in the policy does include um
2:30
you know K through 12th. Um the high
2:32
school had this already. Oak View really
2:35
had this in a good spot. So as you can
2:38
see there's a little bit of difference
2:39
between those buildings and then just
2:41
really it says K8 to add our
2:43
elementarymentaries about no devices uh
2:47
in the building at all. So um but we
2:50
approved this tonight. we will uh get
2:52
this out to our principles and ready to
2:54
go for the 25th. But again, it's it's
2:56
been kind of how we've run business
2:58
thankfully for a while. This is just put
3:00
a little more meat to it. So,
3:03
okay. Looking for a motion.
3:06
Move to approve Vanderbilt.
3:08
Second, Wberg.
3:10
Any discussion?
3:13
All those in favor indicate by saying I.
3:15
I
3:16
oppose. Same sign.
3:18
Motion carries. Moving along to item B,
3:21
first reading of listed policies. We've
3:23
got some five and uh 100 series policies
3:28
to for your review or your consideration
3:30
rather. Uh looking for a motion.
3:33
Move to approve. Wberg
3:35
second. Dickinson.
3:36
Any discussion?
3:39
All those in favor indicate by saying I.
3:42
I.
3:43
Post same sign.
3:45
Um item C, student uh handbook for the
3:50
2526 school year. Any additional
3:53
information on this, Dr. Bloom?
3:55
No, just appreciate any of your
3:56
questions. Just maybe a clerical thing
3:58
for you. The reason they're in two
4:00
different spots. You did the other
4:01
handbooks and consent agenda because we
4:03
do those every year. But we needed to
4:05
have you approve the electronic device
4:10
policy which is included in the
4:12
handbook. But if you would have said no
4:14
or changed it, we would have pulled this
4:16
to fix it. But since you approved it, we
4:18
wanted to make sure the handbook had its
4:20
own new policy, uh, new first reading to
4:23
include the electronic device. So other
4:25
than that, it's pretty straightforward,
4:27
but I know we may have some questions
4:29
about items in the handbook. So ready
4:32
for those after you've done your next
4:34
step.
4:37
Okay. Looking for a motion.
4:40
Move to approve. Dickinson. Second,
4:42
Viella.
4:43
Any discussion?
4:44
Yep.
4:47
Um, so I had um noticed there's no
4:49
mention of transitional kindergarten, so
4:51
hoping we're be adding that.
4:53
We'll be adding that in. Yep. Good call.
4:55
Um, and then the mental health day as an
4:57
unexcused absence. Can you just talk a
5:00
little bit more about that? So th this
5:02
is a good one because
5:06
you know we want our families to
5:08
certainly call and tell us the truth and
5:09
I think we need to have a discussion
5:11
around mental health day is a real a
5:14
real thing when you're physically sick
5:15
or mental sick. So I think we we need to
5:18
probably go back to the drawing board
5:20
and have a conversation about what
5:22
excused and unexcused means with that.
5:25
Um, in reality, from a handbook
5:29
perspective for the board, right, when
5:31
you're talking unexcused or excused, for
5:33
the most part, especially at the 7th
5:35
through 12th grade level, it kind of
5:38
becomes an activity participation thing,
5:40
right? I'm going to take, you know, my
5:42
my son or daughter mental health,
5:45
they're going to be in at noon, so then
5:48
they can be participate in practice
5:50
later this afternoon. like
5:53
we typically have said like no, right?
5:55
You got to be here the whole day. So I I
5:57
do think I would love your feedback, but
6:00
I think there's enough like
6:03
we encourage mental health, we encourage
6:06
physical health. A lot of times we we
6:09
look for doctor's notes in some
6:11
situations,
6:12
but I do think there's a legitimate
6:14
conversation to be have that mental
6:16
health
6:18
could be an excuse thing. And again,
6:19
we're really just talking about how it's
6:21
identified in Infinite Campus
6:25
more than anything related to chronic
6:27
absenteeism or things like that. It's
6:29
really an internal
6:31
documentation, but would love for other
6:33
feedback or questions. I'm trying to
6:35
think of scenarios
6:37
that excused or unexcused would would
6:40
make or break something
6:42
based on, you know, phone call in or
6:45
something like that. So again, Greg,
6:47
jump in. you guys jump in with questions
6:49
or ideas because that's that's one I'm
6:51
sure we've just been
6:54
moving along and
6:55
Yep. I just want to make sure that we're
6:57
that's
6:57
I know that we talked about that's
6:59
important part of this is mental health.
7:01
So I just more clarity on that
7:04
and we still have um
7:07
policy and code around absenteeism and
7:12
chronic absenteeism. So this is just
7:15
simply a another way for parents to
7:19
report to the district.
7:21
Yeah.
7:22
Um my question would then become
7:26
so in my world if you get data you do
7:29
something with your data. Will we be
7:31
monitoring
7:33
how many of these mental health calls
7:35
or absences would be used um as a way to
7:39
provide
7:42
not like we're a referring or mental
7:44
health agency, but obviously if we have
7:46
a student or family that is experiencing
7:49
a great deal of mental health issues, we
7:51
would want to be able to buoy and
7:52
support those families. That would be
7:54
our practice
7:55
for sure. Yeah. Having just pre
7:57
presented to our administrators last
7:59
week at our uh retreat around the
8:02
attendance changes uh one of the things
8:05
I think is really beneficial I know the
8:07
attendants can have had some maybe ill
8:09
feelings at start what's it going to
8:11
mean for us with the layers that are
8:13
built in so 10% now it all goes back to
8:16
how it's coded but an absence is an
8:19
absence so in that return we might
8:21
decide if something is reportable to the
8:24
Dallas County Attorney's office, which
8:26
some of those absences are, but regard
8:28
and some of them aren't. They'd be
8:30
exempt from that, but regardless, at
8:32
some point 10% is 10%.
8:35
Then it's 15% and then and then at that
8:38
point we consider uh an attendance plan
8:41
and now the attendance plan is optional
8:43
by the state. So you don't have to do
8:45
that. Our language says when it begins
8:47
to impact instruction and learning. So
8:50
if a person takes a day here and there
8:52
for their mental health, uh possibly it
8:54
doesn't ever reach that level. Um and it
8:57
may be good for the individual.
8:59
However, if there's a trend
9:01
and I also think we'd want to look at
9:02
day of the week
9:03
that's going to really go down to the
9:05
building level. I I we can certainly
9:06
pull that from Infinite Campus at this
9:08
level. We lack one thing is knowing who
9:10
the kids are, what their story is, what
9:12
their needs are,
9:14
but at that building they have to pull
9:15
all names for those attendance reports.
9:18
So, I would feel like the answer to that
9:20
is yes. That should be something that
9:22
would be caught very quickly. Okay.
9:24
10% is roughly 27 hours.
9:28
Still seems like a lot, but at an hour
9:30
we got the 10% letter.
9:31
Oh, you got the Oh, boy. So,
9:34
he was hospitalized, but and that
9:36
happens, right? And we had an excused
9:38
absence. And I think we're all saying
9:40
the same thing. Mental health is
9:41
important,
9:43
right?
9:43
And and there's different codings,
9:45
right? So it could be a medical excuse,
9:47
somebody with anxiety that has a 504
9:50
plan. Well, 504 plan is a part of the
9:51
attendance coding. Maybe it's a medical
9:53
diagnosis. Maybe it's the one day off
9:56
because I just that's different than a
9:57
medical excuse. So we have a two-page
10:00
document that that instructs attendance
10:02
secretaries and administrators how to
10:03
code that. But either way, all absences
10:06
are being reviewed on that regular
10:08
basis.
10:10
That's you bring up a that's a great
10:13
point to look at. Well, I think
10:15
systemically that's something that we
10:17
would want from our buildings, right? We
10:18
know that certain buildings have higher
10:20
absentee rates than other buildings. We
10:23
know there may be SCEs factors involved,
10:25
right?
10:26
Um, but again, I come from the world of
10:28
data. And when you have data, you have a
10:31
moral impetus to do something with your
10:33
data.
10:33
And we we want to be really careful like
10:35
our MTSS, the multi-tered systems of
10:37
support around behavior tend to tell us
10:39
we want to be careful not to
10:40
intermittently reinforce the wrong
10:42
behavior. If we're not watching it and
10:44
we're just allowing people to take those
10:46
days, we can expect more and more
10:48
absences and that's not what we want to
10:50
have happen. So, we have to be really
10:52
careful that we're thinking about those
10:54
root cause issues and that's what I like
10:56
about the attendance plan. Maybe it was
10:58
better that the state said, "Hey, you
11:00
don't have to do a letter or a plan for
11:02
everybody." I kind of like that
11:04
flexibility. But there are cases where
11:06
we're saying, "Hey, these absences, we
11:08
are judgment free of the absence, but
11:10
these are impacting instruction. So, we
11:12
need to get to the root issue and start
11:14
addressing that. If it's avoidance,
11:16
school avoidance, maybe I I don't want
11:18
to see some. We've talked about bullying
11:20
and harassment in the past. We got to
11:21
really figure out what's at that route
11:23
and address it there.
11:25
Thank you,
11:25
Nancy. Did you have the pleasure of
11:27
getting Charlie's letter in the mail or
11:31
Carson's?
11:32
I got the letter in the mail and I got a
11:34
call from Mrs. Morris
11:36
and she did have a little handwritten
11:38
note on there that said, "I know he's
11:40
been in the hospital and this is a
11:41
formality." Um,
11:44
and I do think that those personal
11:46
relationships at the building matter
11:48
level um really do matter. But as a
11:51
teacher, I've also seen the flip side of
11:53
this, right? The student that is
11:55
utilizing those mental health days
11:57
missing instruction chronically and is
12:01
needing the support system and we need
12:02
to be able to provide that for them. So,
12:04
I just want to make sure that as a
12:06
system we have good checks and balances
12:09
in place so nobody falls through the
12:10
cracks if they need the help.
12:11
This will be good for us to admin team
12:14
follow up with. So, thank you.
12:17
All right.
12:17
And well, I just have some I'll work
12:19
with AJ and some corrections and
12:21
spelling and stuff like that. So,
12:23
anything else for large?
12:24
Um when we talked I mean I don't know
12:28
the late work for Oakview. I guess
12:31
that's not new. I thought maybe it was
12:32
new. So that's just
12:34
but to be clear with
12:35
just make sure that maybe parents know
12:37
that that
12:39
there is some language right in the old
12:41
if you want about
12:42
e x number of days late and how that
12:44
could impact your grade. So
12:47
a making sure our parents and kids are
12:49
aware there but also our end of
12:51
communicating and making teachers got to
12:52
be clear with
12:53
that they students know.
12:55
Absolutely. So no thank you for asking
12:58
that as well
12:58
because I just don't remember that from
12:59
my son last year. So
13:02
that's maybe good that you needated lane
13:04
policy
13:05
out of you. Yes.
13:06
That's all I have. Thank you. Sorry.
13:08
Awesome. Thank you.
13:10
Any other discussion?
13:13
All those in favor indicate by saying I.
13:15
I.
13:16
Oppose. Same sign. Motion carries.
13:19
Moving along to item D, the optional
13:21
school fee. I think this is pretty self
13:23
self-explanatory, but maybe Dr. Bloom if
13:25
you just want to give us a little update
13:28
on why this is here and why the board's
13:30
vote not.
13:31
Yeah. No, I mean typically for the most
13:33
part we don't have a lot of the the
13:37
padlocks are just open. So if a student
13:39
or family would prefer that they have
13:42
their own locked every time their son or
13:43
daughter's an activity. There it is. If
13:46
someone can't afford that, of course,
13:47
we'll work with them. But yeah, it's
13:49
more of a a personal thing to a family
13:51
than we will. So this is just just added
13:54
to the optional fee schedule is that
13:56
they
13:58
can provide our own. Correct. They can
13:59
provide their own. It's just if they
14:00
don't want to go out and
14:01
bingo.
14:02
I will say that I learned at the OPU
14:05
parent boot camp that the reason that
14:07
they're the $14 ones is because or
14:09
whatever you provide has to have a key.
14:11
They have to has to have that's why
14:13
these are $14. If yours doesn't have a
14:15
master key and they can't open it up,
14:17
somebody forgot something, they have to
14:19
click it, cut off
14:20
and then you're out whatever that was.
14:21
Gotcha. When they're done that, it
14:23
didn't open. So, my son had to have his
14:25
cut off.
14:26
And they can get these through bound,
14:28
correct? Is that where they register?
14:30
No,
14:31
through the It's just through where you
14:33
go to pay all of your school fees.
14:34
Oh, on the reg in Infinite Campus. Okay,
14:38
just so families know.
14:39
Yep.
14:39
Mhm.
14:40
Good.
14:40
Thank you for that correction.
14:43
You guys are all over these like he
14:44
impacted you on the kids.
14:47
We paid attention during the OFU parent.
14:49
